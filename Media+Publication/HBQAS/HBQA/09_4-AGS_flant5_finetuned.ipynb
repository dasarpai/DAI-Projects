by Saunaka, approached his priest and in the midst of his brothers said,\n'The Brahmanas versed in the Vedas are following me who am departing for the forest. Afflicted with many calamities I am unable to support them.\nI cannot abandon them, nor have I the power to offer them sustenance: Tell me, O holy one, what should be done by me in such a pass.'\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'After reflecting for a moment seeking to find out the (proper) course by his yoga powers, Dhaumya, that foremost of all virtuous men,\naddressed Yudhishthira, in these words, 'In days of old, all living beings that had been created were sorely afflicted with hunger.\nAnd like a father (unto all of them), Savita (the sun) took compassion upon them. And going first into the northern declension,\nthe sun drew up water by his rays, and coming back to the southern declension, stayed over the earth, with his heat centered in himself.\nAnd while the sun so stayed over the earth, the lord of the vegetable world (the moon), converting the effects of the solar heat (vapours) into clouds\nand pouring them down in the shape of water, caused plants to spring up. Thus it is the sun himself, who, drenched by the lunar influence, is transformed,\nupon the sprouting of seeds, into holy vegetable furnished with the six tastes. And it is these which constitute the food of all creatures upon the earth.\nThus the food that supporteth the lives of creatures is instinct with solar energy, and the sun is, therefore, the father of all creatures.\nDo thou, hence, O Yudhishthira, take refuge even in him. All illustrious monarchs of pure descent and deeds are known to have delivered their people by practising high asceticism.\nThe great Karttavirya, and Vainya and Nahusha, had all, by virtue of ascetic meditation preceded by vows, delivered their people from heavy afflictions.\nTherefore, O virtuous one, as thou art purified by the acts do thou likewise, entering upon a file of austerities. O Bharata, virtuously support the regenerate ones.'\n\"Janamejaya said, 'How did that bull among the Kurus, king Yudhishthira, for the sake of the Brahmanas adore the sun of wonderful appearance?\"\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Listen attentively, O king, purifying thyself and withdrawing thy mind from every other thing. And, O king of kings, appoint thou a time.\nI will tell thee everything in detail, And, O illustrious one, listen to the one hundred and eight names (of the sun)\nas they were disclosed of old by Dhaumya to the high-souled son of Pritha.

For the acquisition of prosperity,\nI bow down to thee, O Bhaskara, blazing like unto gold or fire, who is worshipped of the gods and the Pitris and the Yakshas, and who is adored by Asuras, Nisacharas,\nand Siddhas. He that with fixed attention reciteth this hymn at sunrise, obtaineth wife and offspring and riches and the memory of his former existence,\nand by reciting this hymn a person attaineth patience and memory. Let a man concentrating his mind, recite this hymn. By doing so,\nhe shall be proof against grief and forest-fire and ocean and every object of desire shall be his.'\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having heard from Dhaumya these words suitable to the occasion, Yudhishthira the just, with heart concentrated within itself and purifying it duly,\nbecame engaged in austere meditation, moved by the desire of supporting the Brahmanas. And worshipping the maker of day with offerings of flowers and other articles,\nthe king performed his ablutions. And standing in the stream, he turned his face towards the god of day.
