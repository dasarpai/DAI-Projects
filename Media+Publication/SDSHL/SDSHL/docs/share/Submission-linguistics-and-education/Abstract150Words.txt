Hindi is third most spoken language on our planet. Like English which is written in Roman script, Hindi also does not have its own script. All the Hindi speaking people write Hindi in Devanagari script. Hinglish is a mix language and it is spoken by Hindi speaking, English educated people and they can add words from other Indian languages during their conversation. Unlike Hindi Hinglish has its own script and this script is called Hinglish script. This script has characters borrowed characters from Roman and Devanagari scripts. In this paper we proposed automatic sarcasm detection in Hinglish language. Here we used ten classification libraries and developed 109 classification models, including 4 classification models developed using neural network. We analysed the performance of those models against the embedding and classifier used. Our best model with fastTextWiki embedding and Na√ØveBayesian classifier gives  76% F1 score.
