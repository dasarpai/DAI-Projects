Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n","New events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.\n"]}],"source":["print(df.content.values[0])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vUxJFvah264z"},"source":["## 2.3 Create answers based on the context\n","Use davinci-instruct to answer the questions given the relevant Wikipedia section contents\n","\n","Note: We have used temperature=0, but it may be beneficial to experiment with a higher temperature to get a higher diversity of questions.\n","\n","<span style=\"color:orange\">**WARNING: This step will last a long time, and consume a lot of tokens, as it calls davinci-instruct for every section to answer all the questions.**</span>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bNr_VBvy264z"},"outputs":[],"source":["openai.api_key = secret_key\n","def get_answers(row):\n","    try:\n","        response = openai.Completion.create(\n","            engine=\"davinci-instruct-beta-v3\",\n","            prompt=f\"Write answer based on the text below\\n\\nText: {row.context}\\n\\nQuestions:\\n{row.questions}\\n\\nAnswers:\\n1.\",\n","            temperature=0,\n","            max_tokens=257,\n","            top_p=1,\n","            frequency_penalty=0,\n","            presence_penalty=0\n","        )\n","        return response['choices'][0]['text']\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print (e)\n","        return \"\"\n","\n","\n","df['answers']= df.apply(get_answers, axis=1)\n","df['answers'] = \"1.\" + df.answers\n","df = df.dropna().reset_index().drop('index',axis=1)\n","print(df[['answers']].values[0][0])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qjMIzjdV2640"},"source":["These are the answers to the questions above based on the context around the host city selection.\n","\n","We can see that answers 3-5 contain the correct answer, but instead of answering the question directly, the answer is a verbatim extraction.
