# Question Explored
For your flight dataset, here are some key questions you can explore along with potential visualizations in Python:

1. What is the distribution of departure delays across all flights?
2. What is the average departure delay by airline?
3. What is the relationship between scheduled departure time and actual departure time?
4. What is the relationship between departure delay and taxi-out time?
5. How do departure delays vary by day of the week?
6. Are flights departing from certain airports more delayed than others?
7. What is the trend of departure delays over time (e.g., by month or year)?
8. How do cancellation rates differ by airline?
9. Is there a relationship between distance and flight time?
10. How does the scheduled arrival time compare to actual arrival time?
11. What are the most common cancellation reasons?
12. How does the air time compare to the scheduled time?

## 1. **Flight Delays and Cancellations**
   - **Questions**:
     - What is the distribution of departure delays and arrival delays across different airlines?
     - Is there a correlation between scheduled time and actual air time?
     - How often do flights get delayed or canceled?
     - Are there specific airports associated with more delays or cancellations?
   - **Visualizations**:
     - Histogram of departure delays and arrival delays.
     - Box plot of delays for different airlines.
     - Heatmap of correlation between scheduled time, air time, and delays.
     - Pie chart showing the proportion of canceled flights.

## 2. **Flight Times and Distances**
   - **Questions**:
     - How do scheduled flight times compare to actual elapsed times?
     - What is the relationship between flight distance and air time?
     - Which airports have the longest average flight times?
   - **Visualizations**:
     - Scatter plot of scheduled time vs. actual elapsed time.
     - Scatter plot showing air time vs. flight distance.
     - Bar chart of average flight time by airport.

## 3. **Flight Route and Origin-Destination Analysis**
   - **Questions**:
     - Which are the most frequent origin-destination pairs?
     - Do certain flight routes tend to have more delays?
     - How does the number of flights vary by origin airport?
   - **Visualizations**:
     - Bar chart of the top origin-destination pairs.
     - Heatmap or scatter plot of delays by origin and destination airports.

## 4. **Time of Day Analysis**
   - **Questions**:
     - How do delays vary by time of day (e.g., morning vs. evening)?
     - Are flights more likely to be delayed during certain hours?
   - **Visualizations**:
     - Line plot of delays (departure or arrival) across different hours of the day.
     - Histogram of departure times to see peak times.

## 5. **Airline Performance**
   - **Questions**:
     - Which airline has the highest average departure delay?
     - How do different airlines compare in terms of on-time performance?
   - **Visualizations**:
     - Bar chart of average departure delays by airline.
     - Pie chart or bar plot showing the proportion of on-time vs. delayed flights for each airline.
