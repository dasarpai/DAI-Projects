Coram:- Hon'ble Mr.Justice J.S. Khehar
        Hon'ble Ms. Justice Nirmaljit Kaur


Present: Mr. Bhim Sen Sehgal, Advocate
         for the petitioner.

          Ms. Ranjana Shahi, Central Govt. Standing Counsel
          for the respondents.
                    ...
J.S. Khehar, J. (Oral).
Written statement on behalf of the respondents, has been filed in Court today. The same is taken on record, subject to all just exceptions. Copy thereof has been furnished to the learned counsel for the petitioner.
Through the instant writ petition, the petitioner has claimed the implementation of the Government of India, Ministry of Defence notification/letter dated 1.2.2006 for enhancement in pensionary benefits for personnel below the "officer rank" from 1.1.1996 onwards, instead of the cut off date of 1.1.2006 depicted in the notification dated 1.2.2006. It is not a matter of dispute, that the instant issue has been adjudicated upon by this Court in Gurmel Singh Dhandi and others Vs. Union of India and others (Civil Writ Petition No.6223 of 2007, decided on 26.5.2008).
Having considered the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, and heard learned counsel for the respondents, we are satisfied that the controversy raised in the instant writ petition is identical to the one adjudicated upon by this Court in Gurmel Singh's case (supra).
In view of the above, the instant writ petition is disposed of in terms of the decision rendered by this Court in Gurmel Singh's case (supra).
