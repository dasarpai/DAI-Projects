Court No. - 51

Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 20993 of 2010

Petitioner :- Ankur Singh
Respondent :- State Of U.P.
Petitioner Counsel :- V.K. Mishra
Respondent Counsel :- Govt. Advocate

Hon'ble Arvind Kumar Tripathi,J.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.
Learned counsel for the applicant contended that showing six cases against the applicant in the Gang Chart applicant has been challaned under the Gangster Act along with other co-accused. In Case Crime No. 168/10, under Section 392/411 I.P.C., the applicant was falsely implicated showing recovery of chain. In Case Crime No. 477/10, under Section 356 I.P.C. Final Report was submitted. In Case Crime No. 2348/08, under N.D.P.S. Act, in which the applicant was challaned showing recovery of Charas, applicant was acquitted. In other cases under Sections 302, 307 I.P.C. and 3/25 Arms Act. In those cases applicant has already been released on bail. However, in the present case, applicant is in jail since 09.4.2010. If the applicant is released on bail he will not misuse the liberty of bail.
Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, I find it a fit case for bail.
Let the applicant namely, Ankur Singh be released on bail in Case Crime No. 256 of 2010, under section 3(1) of U.P. Gangster and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, P.S. Tiwaripur, District Gorakhpur on his furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Court concerned.
