                       W.P.(C) NO. 5658 OF 2008 W
                     ====================

                 Dated this the 19th day of March, 2008

                               J U D G M E N T
The prayer in this writ petition is to direct the respondents to issue NOC to the petitioner for transfer of ownership of vehicle bearing Regn.No.KL-07 AR 1617.
2. On instructions, learned Government Pleader today submits that the vehicle in question is involved in Crime No.204/05 of Munampam Police Station. It is stated that on account of this, the 1st respondent has given a report to the 2nd respondent to keep in abeyance all proceedings for transfer of the vehicle and hence everything is kept in abeyance.
3. With the instruction that is now received, I do not think it will be proper for this court to direct issuance of NOC. If a vehicle is involved in a crime, certainly the respondents are justified in not issuing an NOC until the trial of the case is over. At this stage, the writ petitioner cannot seek the direction sought for.
Writ petition is dismissed.
ANTONY DOMINIC,JUDGE.
