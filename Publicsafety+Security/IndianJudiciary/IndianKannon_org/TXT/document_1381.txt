(5) The Central Government may, at the request of the Government of a country to which the Safety Convention applies, approve the grain-loading plan of a ship registered in that country if the Central Government is satisfied, in the like manner as in the case of an Indian ship, that such approval can properly be given and where approval is given at such a request, it shall contain a statement that it has been so given.
(6) It is hereby declared that for the purposes of section 208 (which requires document relating to navigation to be delivered by the master of a ship to his successor) the plan shall be deemed to be a document relating to the navigation of the ship.]
