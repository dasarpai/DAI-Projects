Ram Bachan Prasad vs The State Of Bihar &Amp; Ors on 19 August, 2010
                  IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                        CWJC No.8857 of 2009
                          RAM BACHAN PRASAD
                                Versus
                     THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS.
                             -----------
3. 19.08.2010 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in spite of the order of status quo passed in this case on 06.08.2009 and the specific orders passed in his separate writ application on 31.03.2010 as contained in Annexure-9, salary of the petitioner for the period July, 2009 up- to-date has not been released. This is a clear contempt of this Court.
Learned counsel for the respondents is granted one week time to seek instruction as to why in spite of the specific orders, salary of the petitioner has not been paid.
In the meanwhile, learned counsel for the petitioner may also file a supplementary affidavit in support of his submission that in the wake of proposal of the Patna Government Ayurvedic College to be taken over by the Central Government, petitioner has been shifted from the College by the respondents only to accommodate their own persons here.
Put up after one week within first-ten cases.
     BT                                            (J. N. Singh, J.)
