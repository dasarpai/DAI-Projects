It was affirmed by the CIT (A) on 23rd of January, 1992, but the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal by its judgment dated 30th July, 1992 set aside the order of penalty on the ground that there was no concealment.

The explanation was submitted at the time of assessment before the Assessing Officer, but it was not accepted. By order dated 14th September, 1987, the Assessing Officer held that a sum of Rs. 40,532/- was unexplained and added it to the income of the assessee. It was challenged by the assessee before the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (hereinafter referred to as "DCIT (Appeals)" for short) in ITA No. 66/D/87-88. DCIT (A) by its judgment dated 30th March, 1988 accepted the explanation submitted by the assessee and deleted the addition.

6. In view of the aforesaid order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, two separate applications, both under Section 256(1) of the Act, at the instance of the Revenue, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has referred the following question for this Court's opinion:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Hon'ble Tribunal was justified in concluding that no penalty under Section 271(1)(c) is leviable?"
7. Learned counsel for the assessee raised preliminary objection relating to maintainability of second appeals as were preferred before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. Reliance was placed on a decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. CAMCO Colour Co., reported in (2002) 254 ITR 565 (Bom) : (2002) 122 TAXMAN 336 (Bom). In the said case, the Bombay High Court noticed a policy decision taken by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (hereinafter referred to as "the CBDT", for short) which was circulated vide Circular F No. 279/126/98-ITJ, dated 27th March, 2000. The CBDT directed the revenue not to raise questions of law where the tax effect is less than the amount prescribed in the instructions issued by it. The said Circular reads as under :
"INSTRUCTION NO. 1979 F. No. 279/126/98-ITJ Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue Central Board of Direct Taxes New Delhi dated the 27th March, 2000.
To All Chief Commissioners of Income-tax/Directors General of Income-tax.
Sir, Sub : Revising Monetary limits for filing Departmental appeals/references before Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, High Courts and Supreme Court.
Measures for reducing litigation-regarding Reference is invited to Board's Instructions No. 1903, dt. 28th Oct., 1992, and Instruction No. 1777, dt. 4th Nov., 1987, wherein monetary limits of Rs. 25,000 for Departmental appeals (in income-tax matters) before the Appellate Tribunal, Rs. 50,000 for filing reference to the High Court and Rs. 1,50,000 for filing appeal to the Supreme Court were laid down.
2. In supersession of the above instruction, it has now been decided by the Board that appeals will be filed only in cases were the tax effect exceeds the revised monetary limits given hereunder :
(Tax effect)
(i) Appeal before the Appellate Tribunal (in Income-tax matters) Rs. 1,00,000
(ii) Appeal under Section 260-A/reference under Section 256(2) before the High Court Rs. 2,00,000
(iii) Appeal in the Supreme Court Rs. 5,00,000 The new monetary limits would apply with reference to each case taken singly. In other words, in group cases, each case should individually satisfy the new monetary limits. The working out of monetary limits will therefore, not take into consideration the cumulative revenue effect as envisaged in Board's earlier instruction referred to above.
3. Adverse judgments relating to the following should be contested irrespective of revenue effect :
(i) Where Revenue audit objection in the case has been accepted by the Department.
(ii) Where Board's order, notification, instruction or circular is the subject-matter of an adverse order.
(iii) Where prosecution proceedings are contemplated against the assessee.
(iv) Where the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Act are under challenge.
4. Special Leave Petitions under Article 136 of the Constitution are filed before the Supreme Court only in consultation with Ministry of Law. Therefore, where the Chief CIT decides to contest an adverse judgment by filing special leave petition before the Supreme Court, they should send the proposal to the Board for further processing.
5. These instructions will apply to litigation under other direct taxes also e.g. wealth-tax, gift-tax, estate duty, etc.
6. These monetary limits will not apply to writ matters.
7. This instruction will come into effect from 1st April, 2000.
Sd/ (Anuradha Goyal) Dy. Secretary to the Govt. of India"
8. Having noticed the instruction aforesaid, the Bombay High Court held that the Revenue should not have preferred any such appeal covered by the instruction and dismissed the appeal in limine.
9. Counsel for the Revenue submitted that the instruction is not mandatory. If the law permits to prefer appeal, Revenue cannot be prohibited to do so, but such submission cannot be accepted as the circular issued by the CBDT is binding on all the officers and appeal.
10. In the circumstances, we agree with the submissions made by the counsel for the assessee that the Revenue should not have preferred appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal with regard to petty amount of Rs. 16,300/- or Rs. 40,532/- which is covered by the Instruction of the CBDT including Instruction No. 1903, dated 28th October, 1992 and Instruction No. 1777, dated 4th November, 1987 which have been referred to in Instruction No. 1979, dated 27th March, 2000, as quoted above.
11. The other question is whether there was a concealment on the part of the assessee for the purpose of imposing penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act. The word "concealment" as mentioned in Section 271 of the Act fell for consideration before the Supreme Court in the case of K.C. Builders and Anr. v. The Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, reported in JT 2004 (2) SC 100 wherein the following observation was made by the Apex Court:
"The word "concealment" inherently carried with it the element of mens rea. Therefore, the mere fact that some figure or some particulars have been disclosed by itself, even if takes out the ease from the purview of non-disclosure, it cannot by itself take out the case from the purview of furnishing in accurate particulars. Mere omission from the return of an item of receipt does neither amount to concealment nor deliberate furnishing of inaccurate particulars of income unless and until there is some evidence to show or some circumstances found from which it can be gathered that the omission, was attributable to an intention of desire on the part of the assesses to hide or conceal the income so as to avid the imposition of tax thereon. In order that a penalty under Section 271(1)(iii) may be imposed, it has to be proved that the assessee has consciously made the concealment or furnished inaccurate particulars of his income."
12. In the present case, the assessee explained the cash amount which was found in his possession, though it was not accepted by the assessing authority, but the first appellate Court accepted it. However, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal affirm the order passed by the assessing authority. In such a situation, even if it is presumed that the particulars have not been properly disclosed by the assessee, mere omission from the return of the amount does not amount, to concealment, as observed by the Supreme Court. There is nothing on the record to suggest that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the assessee in furnishing of inaccurate particulars of income. Even no circumstantial evidence found from which it can be gathered that the omission was attributable to an intention of desire on the part of the assessee to hide or conceal the income so as to avoid the imposition of tax thereon.
13. In the aforesaid circumstances, I hold that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in concluding that no penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act is leviable. It is accordingly, decide in affirmative and in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.
