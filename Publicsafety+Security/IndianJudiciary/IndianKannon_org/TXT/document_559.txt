6 25-02-2011 Heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned counsel for the State and learned counsel for the informant in respect of I.A. No. 273/2011 through which the appellant has renewed his prayer for bail on merits.
The prayer has been earlier rejected on two occasions and we find no good ground to take a different view in the matter. The prayer for bail is again rejected at this stage.
