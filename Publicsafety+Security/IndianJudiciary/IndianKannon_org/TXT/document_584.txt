Facts

1. The  applicant  preferred  RTI  application  dated  1  November 2009  before Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, north­west region, Chandigarh  seeking information regarding action taken on his letters of 18 December  2007 and 31 March 2009 and other related information through 12 points -  enclosed herewith as Annexure A.
2. The   CC   I   T,   Chandigarh   forwarded   the   same   to   the   CC   I   T,  Ludhiana under section 6 (3) of the Act who further transferred the RTI  application  to   the   Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  -   II,   Jalandhar  on  the  grounds that they were the holders of information.
3. Vide order dated 14 December 2009 the Commissioner of Income  Tax   provided   point   wise   information   to   the   appellant   against   which  appellant preferred appeal dated 9 February 2010 before first appellate  authority - CC IT, Ludhiana.
4. The CCIT, Ludhiana vide his order of 25 February 2010 informed  the appellant that the CIT is the appellate authority for any order passed by  the   officer   under   his   administrate   control   as   per   instructions   dated   7  September   2007   passed   by   the   office   of   the   Chief   Commissioner   of  Income Tax, Ludhiana and that any appeal on the appellate order passed  by   the   Commissioner   of   Income   Tax   straightaway   lies   to   Central  Information   Commission   and   the   CCIT   does   not   act   as   an   appellate  authority on such order.
5. Consequently,   appellant   preferred   second   appeal   before   the  Commission.   The   matter   was   heard   today   through   videoconferencing.  Both parties were present as above and made submissions.
6. Appellant stated that the information provided to him by the CIT was  vague and incomplete.
7. Commission notes the averments of the appellant that the CPIO,  Jalandhar - II has in fact not responded to his RTI application and that it is  the   first  appellate  authority  namely,  the   Commissioner  Of   Income  Tax,  Jalandhar   -   II   who   has   provided   information   which   is   not   as   per   the  provisions of the RTI Act, 2005.
Decision
8. At the outset Commission take serious note of the fact that the first  appellate authority and not CPIO has provided information in response to  the RTI application. This is not in conformity with the provisions of section  7 (1) of the Act. First appellate authority is warned to educate himself on  the provisions of the Act and to implement the same without any dilution.
9. While accepting the averments and arguments of the respondent  furnished in a written submission that personal information of a citizen is to  be protected, Commission reminds the respondent that " mere existence  of   an   investigation   process   cannot   be   a   ground   for   refusal   of   the  information; the authority withholding information must show satisfactory  reasons  as   to   why   the   release   of   such   information   would   hamper  the  investigation process." (WP (C) no. 3114/2007 in the case of Bharat Singh  versus   CIC   and   others   -   S   Ravindra   Bhat   J   3   December   2007).  Respondent   has   not   provided   any   reasons   while   denying   information  regarding status of the ongoing enquiry and the conclusions there of.
10. Accordingly it is directed that CPIO will provide information to the  appellant as follows:
Points 1 and 2: provide status of the ongoing enquiry and broad  conclusions arrived at.
Points 3, 8 and 9: no information has been sought by the appellant Points 4, 5, 6, 7 - Information to be provided to Appellant as   it  concerns and has bearing on the revenues of the State.
11. In providing information as sought under  Points 1 and 2 of the RTI  application, CPIO will do so as per the provisions of section 10 the RTI Act  wherever required.
12. Information   to   be   provided   within   three   weeks   of   receipt   of   the  order.
