 As given in the decision
                         In the Central Information Commission 
                                                             at

                                                          ORDER
Background
1. The   Applicant   filed   his   RTI­application   with   the   PIO,   South   East   Central   Railway,   Bilaspur   on  29.10.2008 seeking  certain information in respect of allotment of bed for him in  the rest house of the  public authority. The PIO, on 24.11.2008, provided to the Appellant copies of required documents. 
The Applicant, however, being unhappy with the information, filed his 1st­appeal before the Appellate  Authority, who, in his decision dated 27.01.2009, recorded that the information has been furnished to  the  Appellant.  He  (AA),  however, advised the Applicant to approach the competent authority for  settlement of his grievance. The Applicant, thereafter, filed the present appeal in the Commission on  21.09.2010 stating that he has been denied the rest house by the public authority, and has been  given false information.
Decision 
2. It is noted that the CPIO has furnished the relevant documents to the Appellant and  that   now  the Appellant wants to resolve his grievance (denial of rest house) through  RTI. The RTI Act, however,  does not provide for such relief. The Appellant, should  he  so wish,  may  avail  of  other  existing channels  as  advised by the Appellate Authority  for redressal of his grievance.
3. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
