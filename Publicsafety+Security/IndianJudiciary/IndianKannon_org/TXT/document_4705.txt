                     W.P.(C) NO. 2098 of 2007
                    ----------------------------------
          Dated this the 17th day of September , 2007

                              JUDGMENT
Sri.Jacob Mathew Manalil, the learned counsel for the Municipality submits that permit was initially granted to the 3rd and the 4th respondent and the same was withdrawn subsequently. The learned counsel further submitted that fresh permit, if any, will be issued to respondents 3 or 4 only after hearing the petitioners also. In view of the above submission and taking into account the circumstance that the parties are already before the Civil court by O.S.No.456/2006, I dispose of the writ petition recording the submission of the learned Standing Counsel for the Municipality and relegating the parties to have adjudication of all these issues between them by the Civil court.
PIUS C. KURIAKOSE, JUDGE.
