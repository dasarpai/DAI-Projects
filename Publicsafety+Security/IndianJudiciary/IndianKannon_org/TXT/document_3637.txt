~~~~~~~~~~~ Petitioners are Anganavadi workers, who were engaged on temporary basis. According to the petitioners, even now, as per Ext.P10, the 3rd respondent is entitled to continue such temporary appointment, if there is necessity for the same. It is stated that the petitioners, who continued on temporary engagement, have made Exts.P12 to P15 representations before the 3rd respondent requesting to be retained in service and that these representations are remaining pending. In the above circumstances, this Writ Petition is filed.
2. In the aforesaid facts, the only order that can be passed is to direct the 3rd respondent to consider and pass orders on Ext.P12 to P15, provided the representations have been received and are pending.
3. Therefore, the Writ Petition is disposed of directing the 3rd respondent to consider and pass orders on Exts.P12to P15, provided these representations have been received and are pending, and orders shall be passed, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within four weeks from the date of production of a copy of this judgment along with a copy of the Writ Petition.
