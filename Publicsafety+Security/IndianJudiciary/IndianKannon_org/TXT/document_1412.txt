The contention raised in the appeal is that the pillion rider in a package policy is not covered as no wider premium is paid. In the light of the clarificatory circular dated 16.11.2009 issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority coupled with two Division Bench decisions of this Court reported in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hydrose (2008 (3) KLT 778) and Mathew v. Shaji Mathew (2009 (3) KLT 813) the learned counsel for the insurance company seeks permission to withdraw the appeal. Permission is granted. The appeal is dismissed as withdrawn.
M.N. KRISHNAN, JUDGE.
