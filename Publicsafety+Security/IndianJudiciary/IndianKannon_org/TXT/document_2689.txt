 S.B.Cr. Misc. Bail Application No. 7899 of 2009
Hanuman   vs.  State of Raj. 
----
8.10.2009 HONBLE MR. JUSTICE MAHESH CHANDRA SHARMA Mr.Pushpendra Pal Singh, for the petitioner.
Mr. Pradeep Shrimal, Public Prosecutor.

Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.
This bail application has been filed under section 439 Cr.P.C. The learned counsel for the accused petitioner contended that all the co-accused in the case have been released on bail. The case of the present petitioner is not distinguishable with that of the co-accused, who have been released on bail. The learned counsel for the accused petitioner further contended that the accused petitioner is in judicial lock up for the last two months. The challan has been filed. There is a cross case and the accused party lodged first information report against the complainant party before the first information report lodged by the complainant party. The trial of the case will take time. Hence the accused petitioner should be released on bail. The Public Prosecutor opposed this argument.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the opinion that the accused petitioner Hanuman son of Sitaram shall be released on bail provided he shall submit bail bond in the amount of Rs. 25,000/- with two sureties in the amount of Rs. 12,500/- each to the satisfaction of the trial court for his appearance before the trial court on all dates of hearing and as and when he is called upon to do so.
