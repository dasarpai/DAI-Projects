Petitioner claims that he was the claimant before the MACT, Pala in O.P.(MV) No. 444/99. Ext. P1 award was passed, and thereafter the petitioner sought recovery by filing Ext.P2 Execution Petition as well. However, even after the requisition for recovering the amount under the Revenue Recovery Act, the amount has not been recovered so far and that led the petitioner to file this writ petition.
2. When the matter was taken up for admission it was adjourned with a direction to the Standing Counsel for the respondents to take instructions in the matter. Today, on instruction, it is submitted that the amount in terms of Ext. P1 award will be paid within 3 months from today. Recording the aforesaid submission and directing that the amount shall be paid within 3 months from today, this writ petition is disposed of.
