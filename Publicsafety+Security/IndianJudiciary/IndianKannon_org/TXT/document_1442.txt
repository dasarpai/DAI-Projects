Rajasthan High Court
Chandra Kumar Morwani vs State And Anr on 25 May, 2011
    

 
 
 

 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT JAIPUR BENCH, JAIPUR

ORDER 

S.B. Criminal Misc. Petition No.2244/2008
(Chandra Kumar Morwani Versus State of Rajasthan & Another)


Date of Order    ::       25th May, 2011

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MAHESH BHAGWATI

Mr. Keshav Agrawal, counsel for the petitioner.

BY THE COURT: 
The petitioner is found to have impugned the order dated 8th April, 2008, whereby the learned Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track) No. 7, Jaipur City, Jaipur dismissed the revision petition and the order dated 2nd February, 2008, whereby the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.11, Jaipur City, Jaipur dismissed the application filed by the accused petitioner for sending the disputed cheque to Forensic Science Laboratory for its opinion.
Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, it is noticed that this Court in the case of Mohd. Razak Khan Versus Ahmed Jaan (S.B. Criminal Revision Petition No. 316/2010), having analyzed the matter in detail, vide order dated 29th March, 2010, dismissed the revision petition filed by the petitioner Mohd. Razak Khan and upheld the order of the trial court. The facts of the instant case are quite similar, hence in the light of the order passed by this Court in the case of Mohd. Razak Khan (supra), the impugned orders are found to have suffered from no infirmity. Conversely, they are perfectly legal and warrant no intervention. Hence, the Criminal Misc. Petition filed under Section 482 of CrPC being bereft of any merit deserves to be dismissed, which stands dismissed accordingly.
(MAHESH BHAGWATI),J.
