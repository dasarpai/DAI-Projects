4/ 26.11.2010 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners as well as learned P.P. for the State.
Admittedly, petitioners are Dewars of the deceased whose marriage has taken place in the year 2007 but allegedly, she was killed by her in-laws on 24.8.2009 on account of non-fulfilment of illegal demand of dowry.
It is obvious from perusal of the first information report itself that no allegation of any overt-act has been levelled against petitioner no.2 and he is not named in the FIR. Moreover, learned counsel for the petitioners points out that on 24.8.2009 petitioner no.2 was detained by the Officer Incharge, Maldah police station. So he was not present on the aforesaid date at the place of the occurrence. He further points out that so far petitioner no.1 is concerned, he is junior member of his family and his date of birth is 24.2.1993 which is evident from perusal of annexure 3 of this anticipatory bail application.
In the aforesaid circumstances as well as submissions of the parties, petitioners, namely, Navanit Kumar Nirala @ Munna Kumar and Vijay Kumar Sah @ Vijay Prasad, in the event of their arrest/ surrender within 30 days from the date of communication of the order, be released on bail in connection with Tariyani P.S. Case no. 109 of 2009 on furnishing bail bond of Rs 10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Sub divisional Judicial Magistrate, Sheohar at Sitamarhi subject to condition as laid down under section 438(2) of the Cr. P.C.
