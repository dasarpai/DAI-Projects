K.BALAKRISHNAN NAIR, J.
This Court after hearing both sides passed an interim order in this case on 29-10-2008. In view of the said interim order, no further orders are required in this writ petition. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that police have registered a crime against the sixth respondent for attacking the petitioner. But it was not investigated by the police officers concerned appropriately. If the petitioner is aggrieved by the investigation of the crime, she may work out her remedies before the appropriate forum. In view of the decision in Sakiri Vasu V. State of U.P. 2008(1) KLT 724, this court cannot interfere with the investigation under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, this writ petition is closed, maintaining the afore-mentioned interim order.
