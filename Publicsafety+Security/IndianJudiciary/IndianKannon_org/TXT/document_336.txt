Petitioner :- Buddhi Lal Maurya
Respondent :- District Forest Officer, Raebareli & Others
Petitioner Counsel :- Dinesh Kumar Mishra,Ratna Gupta

Hon'ble Pradeep Kant,J.
Hon'ble Ritu Raj Awasthi,J.
The petitioner, one of the villagers, has approached this Court saying that the opposite parties are making boundary wall around the land, allegedly earmarked as Charagah.
Such a grievance cannot be entertained in writ jurisdiction.
We do not know that under what circumstances, the boundary wall is being constructed, moreso, when it is not clear as to whether the nature of the land is being changed or any construction is being made so as to defeat the purpose of earmarking the land as Charagah.
The petition is dismissed.
Order Date :- 19.7.2010 MFA
