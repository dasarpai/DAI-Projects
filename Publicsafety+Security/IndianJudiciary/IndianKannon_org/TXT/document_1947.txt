The CPIO replied on 3.6.08 stating that cadre of SS/Erector at that time was centralized and controlled by HQ. Hence the question to provide the certified copy of Roster at this end does not arise. He also added that the preservation period for all other types of Registers and Books is three years as per CME's office Memorandum dt.1.8.02. Not satisfied with the reply, the Applicant filed an appeal dt.27.6.08 with the Appellate Authority. On not receiving any reply, he filed a second appeal dt.6.10.08 before the CIC.
