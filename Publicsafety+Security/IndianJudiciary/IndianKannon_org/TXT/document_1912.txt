ORAL
ORDER
Rule.
Learned APP, waives service of rule on behalf of respondent-State.
Learned advocate for the applicant submits that co-accused is already enlarged on bail and considering the above fact and on the ground of parity vis-a-vis role attributed to the applicant, by imposing suitable conditions the applicant may be enlarged on bail.
Considering the above prima facie aspects of the matter, I find this is a fit case for granting bail since charge-sheet is also filed. Under the circumstances, the applicant is ordered to be released on bail in connection with C.R. No.I-178 of 2010 with Pandesara Police Station, Surat, on his furnishing bond of Rs. 5000/-(Rupees Five Thousand) with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of the lower Court and subject to following conditions :
not take undue advantage of his liberty or abuse his liberty;
not act in a manner injurious to the interest of the prosecution;
maintain law and order;
mark his presence before the concerned Police Station on every 1st and 15th day of English Calendar month between 11:00 am to 2:00 pm:
not leave the State of Gujarat without prior permission of the Sessions Judge concerned;
furnish the address of his residence at the time of execution of the bond and shall not change the residence without prior permission of this Court;
surrender his passport, if any, to the Lower Court immediately.
If breach of any of the above conditions is committed, the Sessions Judge concerned will be free to take appropriate action in the matter.
Bail before the Lower Court having jurisdiction to try the case.
Rule is made absolute. Application is disposed of accordingly.
Direct service is permitted.
