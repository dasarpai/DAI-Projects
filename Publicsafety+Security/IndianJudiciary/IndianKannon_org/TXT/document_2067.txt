                             J U D G M E N T
In an election petition filed by the petitioner challenging the election of the returned candidate, the petitioner was declared as elected, by the Munisiff's Court, Nedumangad, as the member of Ward No. 8 of Panavoor Grama Panchayath, in a bye-election held on 24.9.2005. Petitioner's grievance in this writ petition is that the 2nd respondent is not administering oath to the petitioner as required under law. The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent submits that the oath can be administered on 29.1.2009.
Accordingly, I dispose of this writ petition with a direction to the 2nd respondent to administer oath to the petitioner on 29.1.2009, positively, without any default.
S.SIRI JAGAN, JUDGE rhs
