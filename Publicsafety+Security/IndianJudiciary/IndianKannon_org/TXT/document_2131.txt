Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing:
The following were present Appellant: Mr. Shyam Sunder Kaushik Respondent: Mr.G.P.Singh PIO The reply by the respondent shows that the Public authority had no record or knowledge of a complaint made by the Sub-Registrar to the S.H.O. of the Daryaganj Police station about tampering with a Govt. record and 'a conspiracy to cheat'. The respondent states that he does not know how or why the complaint is not on the records of the Public authority. The appellant is pointing out a case at point 2 where the Public authority in February 2008 has acknowledged that 'After inspecting the peshi register, it has been observed that there is no cutting/ overwriting in that particular entry in peshi register. However, the record/file pertaining to police report for tampering of records is not available in this office.' The respondent states that investigations are going on. The Commission sees that the technical needs of giving the information have been met, but the Public authority seems extremely reluctant to take action to stop what appears to be doubtful practices. Inspite of a Citizen showing doubtful transactions, the Public authority does not appear to be vigorously doing anything.
