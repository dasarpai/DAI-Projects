ORAL
ORDER
(Per : HONOURABLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MR. M.S.SHAH) Without going into the question whether this Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable, otherwise also, the Appeal deserves to be dismissed, as the contentions sought to be raised in this Appeal were already raised earlier in Civil Revision Application No.1139 of 1986, which came to be dismissed by a learned Single Judge by judgment dated 17.10.2002.
At this stage, Mr. Harin P. Raval, learned counsel for the appellant, submits that the appellant may be given sometime to vacate the suit-premises.
Since this Appeal is filed only by original defendant no.1 and the decree of eviction was passed inter alia on the ground that the suit-premises were sub-let by the appellant's father to defendant nos. 2 and 3 (present respondent nos. 6 and 7), it would be for the concerned parties, who are in possession of the suit premises, to move the executing court with such a request.
The Letters Patent Appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed and is hereby dismissed.

SHAH, Actg. C.J.) (D.H. WAGHELA, J.) [sn devu] pps     Top
