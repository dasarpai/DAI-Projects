ORAL
ORDER
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.L.DAVE) Learned advocate Mr.A.S.Vakil states that the dispute between the parties has been amicably settled and the petitioner has advised his advocate to withdraw the petition immediately by communication dated September 19, 1997, copy of which was addressed to Managing Director, State Bank of Saurashtra. He places on record a xerox copy of the said communication, which is taken on record.
In the light of the above development, learned advocate Mr.A.S.Vakil does not press this appeal, reserving the right of the appellant to press for revival of this appeal, in case of difficulty, since the Special Civil Application is still not withdrawn by the respondent herein. Permission as prayed for is granted. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly, with no order as to costs.
