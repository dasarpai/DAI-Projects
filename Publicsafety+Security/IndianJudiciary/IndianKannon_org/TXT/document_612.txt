ORAL
ORDER
(Per : HONOURABLE Ms.JUSTICE SONIA GOKANI)
1. In this Application, applicant seeks relief of condonation of delay of 370 days in filing the Tax Appeal by enlisting various grounds for late presentation of the Appeal.
2. On issuance of the notice, learned counsel Mrs. Mauna Bhatt has filed her appearance for and on behalf of the respondent-Income Tax Department. On hearing learned counsels of both the sides and on duly considering the reasons set forth by the petitioner, there appears to be justifiable reason to accede to the request of petitioner without emphasizing on procedurality or technicality. It also needs to be noted that petitioner is a Co-operative Bank and after the first order of Tribunal, it had further pursued the remedy by filing Misc. Application twice. Cumulatively, when the reasons are appreciated, this Court is of the opinion that the application deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, Application for condonation of delay is allowed. Registry is directed to number the Tax Appeal and place the same on board next week for hearing, after completing the formality of registration
3. OJ Misc. Application, accordingly, stands disposed of with no order as to costs.
