                         RAJESH KUMAR @ RAJESH CHAUDHARY
                                      Versus
                              1. STATE OF BIHAR
                              2. Usha Devi
                                      ------
14/ 13.12.2010 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State.
Torture in different ways for demand of dowry is the allegation and defence is willful desertion by the wife corroborated by her act in Court to not appear on a single date physically. In my view also, that justifies petitioner for grant of anticipatory bail.
Accordingly, prayer of the petitioner is allowed. In the event of arrest or surrender within one month from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order in connection with Pawna P.S. Case No. 53 of 2008 above named petitioner shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of C.J.M., Bhojpur, Ara subject to the conditions as laid down under Section 438(2) of Cr. P.C.
