ORDER
Rule.
Mr.Hasurkar, learned APP waives service of notice of Rule on behalf of respondent-State.
Present application is filed by the applicant-convict through jail by submitting application dated 21/10/2008 for releasing him on temporary bail to attend the marriage ceremony of his daughter and other ceremonies.
It appears that the present application has been received by the Registry of this Court on 05/11/2008 and immediately thereafter the same is processed and circulated today.
Considering the invitation card it appears that the marriage has already taken place on 06/11/2008 i.e. on yesterday and other ceremony which was fixed on 04-05/11/2008 are also over. Even the last ceremony is on today at 12:00 a.m. Under the circumstances practically the present application has become infructuous and the cause for releasing the applicant on temporary bail does not survive. Application stands dismissed. Rule discharged.
