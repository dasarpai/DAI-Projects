                                JUDGMENT
The main relief prayed for in the Writ Petition is to declare that the petitioner is entitled to be promoted to the post of Associate Professor with effect from 2003 and to the post of Professor of Paediatrics with effect from 6.7.2007 respectively and to grant all consequential benefits thereof. After filing the Writ Petition, the petitioner was given notional promotion as per G.O.(Rt) No.4145/2008/H&FWD dated 12.12.2008, however, without back arrears. The petitioner has filed W.P.(C) No.19624 of 2010 to quash the Government Order dated 12.12.2008, to the extent to which it denied back arrears. In view of the subsequent developments, the Writ Petition has become infructuous.
Accordingly, the Writ Petition is dismissed as infructuous.
