 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
          AT PRINCIPAL SEAT, JODHPUR

                     ORDER
                       In
 S.B. Cr. Misc. Bail Application No.3244/2009

          {Sanjay    Versus                 State        of
          Rajasthan}

          Date of Order ::: 17th July, 2009

                    PRESENT
   HON'BLE SHRI JUSTICE NARENDRA KUMAR JAIN

Shri Rahul Bhati, counsel for the petitioner
Shri Anil Joshi, PP for the State of Rajasthan
                      ####


By the Court:
          Heard        learned         counsel           for     the

petitioner(s)         as   well        as      learned         Public

Prosecutor     and     perused    the        relevant     material
made available to me during the arguments of the case.
It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that petitioner is in custody since 15th June, 2009; the allegations in the F.I.R. against the petitioner are not so much of serious nature; the offence is triable by the court of Magistrate, therefore, looking to all the facts and circumstances, the petitioner may be granted the benefit of bail.
After considering the submissions of learned counsel for the parties, examining the record and the facts and circumstances of the case, but without expressing any opinion on its // 2 // merits and demerits, I think it fit and proper to allow this application under Section 439, Cr.P.C. Hence, it is directed that accused- petitioner Sanjay S/o Ganpat Lal Harijan be released on bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. in F.I.R. No. 196/2009, Police Station Pratapgarh registered under Section(s) 341, 394 IPC, provided he furnishes a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand only) together with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for his appearance before that Court on all subsequent dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.
