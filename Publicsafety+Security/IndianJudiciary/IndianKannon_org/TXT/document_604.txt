Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned A.P.P. for the Prosecution.
Petitioner has been made accused for the offence under Sections 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 17/18 CLA Act and 13 UAP Act, in connection with Pirtand P.S. Case No. 12 of 2010, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 636 of 2010 (S. T. No. 274 of 2010).
The case relates to murder of one Chaukidar Chotu Manjhi whose dead body was found and from the place of occurrence some nuxal pamphlets were also found and the case was instituted against unknown.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in this case only on the basis of the confessional statement and there is no other material against the petitioner and, accordingly, has prayed for bail.
The contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioner find support from the impugned order.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner Prakash Hansda is directed to be released on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of learned District & Session Judge, Giridih in connection with Pirtand P.S. Case No. 12 of 2010, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 636 of 2010 (S. T. No. 274 of 2010).
