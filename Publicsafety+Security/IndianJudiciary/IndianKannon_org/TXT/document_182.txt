HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MOHAMMAD RAFIQ

Shri Anshuman Saxena for the petitioners.
Shri Sanjeev Kumar Mehla, Public Prosecutor for State.
******
Contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that bail appliation of petitioner Kuldeep Gupta was rejected on the ground of two previous cases registered against him; one for offence under Section 307 & 120B IPC and another case for minor offence u/Ss.323 & 341 IPC. In this case, he has falsely been implicated. No other previous case is registered against petitioner-Tillu @ Sumit Singh.
Learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the bail applications.
Having regard to the facts aforesaid and considering all other facts and circumstances of the case, I deem it just and proper to enlarge the petitioners on bail.
In the result, these bail applications u/S.439 Cr.P.C. are allowed and it is directed that petitioners (1) Kuldeep Gupta S/o Rajesh Gupta and (2) Tillu @ Sumit Singh shall be released on bail in FIR No.176/2011 registered at P.S. Bhawani Mandi, District Jhalawar for offence under Sections 399 and 402 IPC and Section 4/25 of the Arms Act on each of them furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- together with two sureties in the sum of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the concerned Court for their appearance before that trial court on all dates of hearing until conclusion of the trial.
