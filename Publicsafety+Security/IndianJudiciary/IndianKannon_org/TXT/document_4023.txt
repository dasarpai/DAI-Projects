         ======================================
                    W.P.(C)No.23125 of 2008
         ======================================
            Dated this the 21st day of August 2008

                           JUDGMENT
The petitioner applied for appointment to the post of Lower Division Typist in Thiruvananthapuram District pursuant to Ext.P1 notification issued by the Kerala Public Service Commission. She appeared for the written test on 12.8.2006. She was also included in Ext.P4 short list published by the Kerala Public Service Commission. At the time of verification of certificates, the petitioner produced Ext.P2 certificate to the effect that she has been awarded Diploma in Office Automation by the Electronics Research & Development Centre of India (ER & DCI for short). The petitioner was then directed to produce certificates to prove that the course was directly conducted by ER&DCI. The petitioner thereupon produced Exts.P6 and P7 certificates. However, they were not acceptable to the Commission. Hence, the petitioner was not included in the ranked list published on 5.12.2007. This writ petition was thereupon filed challenging the petitioner's non- inclusion in the ranked list. The petitioner has now produced Ext.P12 certificate dated 17.8.2000 issued by the Centre for Development of Advance Computing (formerly known as ER & DCI) to the effect that the course Diploma in Office Automation was directly conducted by it at Bharat Sevak Samaj, Nedumangad. The petitioner contends that this Court had in Ext.P9 judgment directed the Commission to consider whether the same qualification is acceptable and that Ext.P11 was thereupon issued including the petitioners in W.P.(C) 2879 of 2008 in the ranked list. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as the petitioner has passed the same Diploma course, she is also entitled to be included in the ranked list.
2. This Court had, in Ext.P9 judgment noticed that the eligibility of candidates who have passed the diploma course directly conducted by the C-DAC (formerly ER & DCI) deserves to be considered by the Kerala Public Service Commission. After such consideration, candidates having the same qualification were included in the ranked list. This is not disputed by the respondents.
In the result, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction that in event of the petitioner submitting a representation before the Secretary, Kerala Public service Commission along with a copy of this judgment and the original of Ext.P12, the Commission shall consider the same and take a decision as regards the inclusion of the petitioner's name in the ranked list. If the Commission finds that the petitioner is similarly placed as the petitioner in Ext.P9 judgment, her name also shall be included in the ranked list. The inclusion of the petitioner in the ranked list and her advice will not be to the detriment of candidates already advised from the ranked list till date.
