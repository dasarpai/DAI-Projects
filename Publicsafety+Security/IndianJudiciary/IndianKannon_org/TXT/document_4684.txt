          For the Petitioner      :     Mr. S.S. Choudhary
          For the State           :     A. P.P.
          For the Informant       :     Ms. Nutan Sharma
                                  -----
/24.8.2011       Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned A.P.P. for the
          Prosecution as also learned counsel for the informant.
                 Petitioner has been made accused for the offence under Sections
          147/148/149/324
/341/342/307 of the Indian Penal Code and 27 of the Arms Act, in connection with Sahibganj (M) P.S. Case no.83 of 2011, corresponding to G.R. No. 204 of 2011.
It appears that one Sahibganj Muffasil P.S. Case No.72 of 2011 was instituted against one Baliram Yadav who was apprehended by some person along with fire arm and he was produced before the police in the injured condition. Subsequently, the case has been instituted by the wife of said Baliram Yadav implicating this petitioner also, stating that this petitioner and the other co-accused had assaulted and injured said Baliram Yadav.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner Dahu Yadav is directed to be released on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sahibganj, in connection with Sahibganj (M) P.S. Case no.83 of 2011, corresponding to G.R. No. 204 of 2011.
