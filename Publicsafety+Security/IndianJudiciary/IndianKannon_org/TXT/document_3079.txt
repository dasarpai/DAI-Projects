The landowners have approached this court through the present appeal for further enhancement of the compensation awarded by the learned court below.
Briefly, the facts are that vide notification dated 20.4.1983, issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, 'the Act'), the State of Haryana acquired 21.50 acres of land in the revenue estate of Bahadurgarh for public purpose namely for development and utilisation of land as a residential and commercial area in Sector-7, Bahadurgarh. The Land Acquisition Collector vide his award dated 22.2.1987 assessed the market value of the land at Rs. 50,000/- per acre for nehri/chahi, Rs. 30,000/- per acre for barani and Rs. 25,000/- per acre for banjar kadim/gair mumkin kind of land. Dissatisfied with the award of the Land Acquisition Collector, the landowners/claimants filed objections. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below vide award dated 19.8.1992, determined the market value of the acquired land at Rs. 21/- per square yard.
Learned counsel for the appellants/claimants submitted that the claim made by the appellants in the present appeals is squarely covered by the judgment of this court in R.F.A. No. 996 of 1993 - Bhim Singh and others vs State of Haryana and another, decided on 17.3.2008, whereby the compensation payable for acquisition of land was assessed at Rs. 36/- per square yard.
Learned Assistant Advocate General appearing for the State did not dispute this fact.
For the detailed reasons recorded in Bhim Singh's case (supra), the appeal is allowed in the same terms.
