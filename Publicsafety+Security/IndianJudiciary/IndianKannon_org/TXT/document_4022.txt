ORAL JUDGMENT
Rule.
Mr. Nilesh M. Shah, learned advocate waives service of Rule on behalf of respondent. With consent of learned advocates appearing for the parties, the matter is taken up for final hearing today.
2. The petitioner has approached this Court against order dated 30th August, 2008 whereby the application preferred by the petitioner Taluka Development under Rule 26-A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 has been rejected. An award dated 21.4.2008 is also under challenge. Earlier, by impugned award the learned Labour Court partly allowed Reference (LCB) No. 568 of 1996 directing the petitioner to reinstate the respondent without benefit of backwages. It is the case of the petitioner that the said award came to be passed without considering the submissions/arguments of the present petitioner inasmuch as at the time of hearing of the submissions of the contesting parties, the advocate of the petitioner could not remain present and therefore the submissions and the case of the petitioner on the basis of evidence on record, could not be presented and impugned award, therefore, came to be passed after taking into consideration the submissions only of the respondent. In such circumstances, Misc. Application No. 23 of 2008 came to be filed which has been rejected by impugned award. Mr. N.L. Shah for respondent submitted that earlier also the Reference was decided in absence of the petitioner and had to be restored at the request of petitioner and it was for the second time that the petitioner ignored the proceedings. Mr. Munshaw submitted that if the matter is remanded only for the limited purpose of hearing the submissions, since the evidence of both sides is recorded, the petitioner may at least get opportunity to make submissions before Labour Court and the Labour Court may pass appropriate order after considering the case of petitioner. Today, during submissions, a limited consensus between the parties is arrived at. Mr. Shah, learned advocate for the respondent submitted that if reasonable cost of Rs. 7,500/- is awarded and time limit is fixed, then he would not have objection in respect of petitioner's request. Considering the said submissions of Mr. Shah, it is directed that the order dated 30th August, 2008 and the order dated 21.4.2008 are set aside. The award dtd. 21.4.2008 and order dated 30.8.2008 are set aside and the proceedings of Reference [LCP] No. 568 of 1996[old Reference [lca] No. 1037/94 are restored. The matter is remanded for hearing of submissions. The Labour Court shall issue fresh notice of hearing of arguments of concerned parties. On the date fixed by the Labour Court the petitioner will not seek any adjournment on any reason. If the petitioner's advocate has any inconvenience, then the petitioner may make alternative arrangement and in any case the adjournment shall not be requested for by the petitioner. The Labour Court may try to hear and decide the matter after considering the submissions of both sides as early as possible and preferably before 15th April, 2009.
3. The aforesaid order is passed on condition that the petitioner shall pay an amount of Rs. 7,500/- [Seven Thousand Five Hundred] towards cost to the respondent which would not be adjustable.
4. With the aforesaid clarifications and directions, the petition is disposed of. Rule is discharged.
