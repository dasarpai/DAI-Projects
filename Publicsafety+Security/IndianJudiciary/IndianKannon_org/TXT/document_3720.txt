"If the above said Writ Petition or any SLP that the ESI Corporation may choose to file in the Supreme Court is decided in favour of the Corporation, I shall refund forthwith the entire arrears of pay of allowances and also the excess pay and allowances that might have been paid to me consequent upon implementation of the Orders of the Tribunal."
In the said undertaking it was also mentioned that "in the event of my failure to refund the arrears and also the excess payment made forthwith, the Corporation shall have a right to recover such amounts from me."
4. In view of the categoric undertaking submitted by the employees, they are under an obligation to refund the excess amount paid to the Corporation or the Corporation would be at liberty to recover excess amount paid tot he employees.
5. In the facts and circumstances of this case, we direct the Corporation to recover the excess amount paid to the employees within six years by fixing yearly installments.
6. Looking to the peculiar facts of this case, we further direct the Corporation not to recover the amount from the legal heirs of the deceased employees.
With this observation, the appeal is disposed of, leaving the parties to bear their own cost.
