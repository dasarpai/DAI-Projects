WP 14990/O9 the effect that the plaintiff had quoted Rs.70,000/-- for one acre of land and the defendant No.1 had finally agreed to purchase one acre of land at This Portion of the written statement has to"-..3,:3'€~ and the contention that the plaintiff 'had 'ioffei-e,d»'pri_ce" Rs.5,65,000/-- in addition to other: facts the execution of agreement oiﬂsaie and"the persons who were present as attestiiig persor1s,.etVc7;~.,duringAA execution of the sale deed is sought to inserte_'d._'.in the Written statement. €to"'hei',.::th'e'admission made by the being' withdrawn from the proposed ,,amend.mient'gandsuch an amendment cannot be granted. uh'
-this aspect of the matter, the counsel the decision of the Apex Court in the 'V..pcase'ofﬁH_EERAIAL v.

WP 1.4990/O9 amount to totally displacing the case of plaintiff--___and which would cause him irretrievable prejudiced.
7. Now, as could be seen from if in the pleadings of the parties, it:-is"'a'--sp&ecific.the"; plaintiff that she never sold measyuring acre out of revision Survey at any time. It is her COriff3.11tiOiilllthiﬁl; docurnent is bad for want of consideration.-lhylt 'is; als_o_:ll1ervcontention that the defe11dant'xi\'I:yf;,1lging cases has taken disadvantage also claims that there was fraud-- played'-».loy.the"defendants and they got the land throiigh. llllthlej deed dated 15.04.2001. Accoizdiing to Ifthe.._..1Z)lai.11tiff, there is no question of 1'eceiVi11g'~any"sale consideration by the defendants at thenltirne alleged sale transaction. Whereas, the '.V.defendalln1_t No.1 in the written statement in both the A though initially claimed that the plaintiff proposed to purchase the land for Rs.70.000/-- per acre if has sought: for its deletion contending that the land was re , ../ .< '-w,.,g 8 \VP 12350/09 & WE' E4990/09 agreed to be purchased for an amount of Rs.E3,65,000/~ and there were agreements for sale between the parties-
8. In my considered opinion, it daesi.ﬂ'r:1ot amount to any admission and in the eircum'st.anees M cannot be said that the admissi:on"is« In that View of the matter, theA:4'deC.ision».':;_fhthe Court referred supra is not"'a}T5p1iCat)Ie._t0.et'he".faets on hand.
