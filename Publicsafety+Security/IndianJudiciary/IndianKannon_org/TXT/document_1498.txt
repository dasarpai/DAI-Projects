He has also contended that the applicant also got seriously injured while trying to save the deceased. He has also contended that the present applicant is falsely implicated in the present case. He, therefore, contended that the applicant is required to be released on regular bail.
As against this, Mr.Parikh, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, has strongly opposed the present application and read the order passed by the trial Court.
I have gone through the order passed by the trial Court as well as papers produced on record of the case. Looking to the allegations levelled against the applicant, I am inclined to release him on regular bail.
Learned counsel for the parties do not press for a reasoned order.
Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the application is allowed and applicant is ordered to be released on bail in connection with CR No.I-26 of 2010 registered with Mahila Police Station, Rajkot for the offences alleged against him in this application on his executing a bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand Only) with one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the lower Court and subject to the conditions that he shall, (I) not take undue advantage of his liberty or abuse his liberty;

(iv) furnish the present address of residence to the Investigating Officer as well as to the Court at the time of furnishing bond and shall not change his residence till further orders ;
(v) Surrender his passport, if any, to the lower Court within a week;
(vi) maintain law and order;
The Authority will release the applicant only if he is not required in connection with any other offence for the time being.
If breach of any of the above conditions is committed, the concerned Sessions Judge will be free to issue warrant or take appropriate action in the matter.
