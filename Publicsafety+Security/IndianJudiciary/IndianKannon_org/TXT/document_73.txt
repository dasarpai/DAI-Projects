ORAL
ORDER
1. The petitioners are shown as accused in an M. Case No.18/10, registered at Bhanvad Police Station, pursuant to an order dated 21.07.2010, passed by the concerned Magistrate, directing the registration of such an FIR and calling for a report, within a period of 30 days.
2. The grievance of the petitioners is that they are falsely involved and that they are completely un-related to the incident and are distant relatives, who have been falsely roped in.
3. At this stage, since the investigation is, still, going on, it is not appropriate to comment on the contentions of the petitioners. However, needless to say that the Investigating Officer shall not cause arrest of the petitioners at random, without there being, at lest, some prima facie material for suspecting that they have committed the offences in question.
4. With the above observations, this petition is disposed of, at this stage.
