As given in the decision 
                       In the Central Information Commission 
                                                            at

                                                                                        File No: CIC/AD/C/2011/000027

                                                         ORDER
Background
1. The Applicant, through his RTI­application dated 25.08.2010, wanted to obtain from the PIO, RPO,  Hudco  Trikoot­3   New  Delhi  photocopies  of  the  documents submitted by  Ms. Asha  Gupta to the  passport authority as a proof for her age and address while applying for the passport. The PIO, on  27.09.2010, informed the Applicant that the 3rd­party, when consulted, had objected to the disclosure  of the information and that on examination of the case, they had also found no larger public interest in  disclosing the same. They accordingly declined to disclose the information to the Applicant under  Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI­Act. The Appellate Authority, in his 1st­appeal, also endorsed the CPIO's  view through his order dated 19.11.2010. The Applicant, aggrieved with this reply, filed the present  appeal in the Commission on 03.12.2010 questioning the decision of the Respondents. Decision
2. The Appellant, during the hearing,  while arguing that public interest is involved in the information he  is seeking,  stated that the documents submitted by the 3rd­party  to the passport office as a proof of  her age to get the passport, are fake. He, in support of his contention, produced certain documents  viz., copy of high school certificate from KP Inter College, Allahabad of the 3rd­party which, according  to a confirmation received by the Appellant under RTI from the   KP Inter College,   is not genuine  since   the   College   is   a   boys'   college   as     also   a   response   from   UP   Board   of   High   School   &  Intermediate Education, Allahabad stating that no certificate dated 15 June, 1989 and bearing No.  5543020  was issued by the concerned authority.  
3.  During the hearing the Appellant admitted that what he is really seeking is not the information but  for  the passport of  Ms. Asha Gupta to be revoked and stated that  he would then not be interested in  pursuing the RTI matter .   The Respondent at this stage suggested that if the Respondent complains  formally   to   the   passport   office   regarding   the  fake   certificate  submitted  by  Ms.  Asha  Gupta,   the  passport office will enquire into the matter and take appropriate action. 
4. A copy of the complaint already filed by the Appellant with the passport office was then handed over  to the Respondent once again, in the presence of the undersigned. Based on the discussions, the  Commission  strongly    recommends  that the passport office   enquire into this matter and if the  allegations of the Appellant are found to be true, to revoke Ms. Gupta's passport.   The   passport  officer may wish to keep the Appellant informed about the action being taken on his complaint at each  stage and also share with him the enquiry report as also information on action taken , if any, on the  passport of Ms. Gupta.  This exercise may preferably be completed by end of April, 2011. 
5. The appeal is  disposed of with the above  recommendation.
