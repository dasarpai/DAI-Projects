Call for the lower court record. The appellants being the father, younger brother and brother's wife of husband have been convicted under Sections 304(B) and 498A of the Indian Penal Code.
Though general accusation is of poising against the entire family but it appears that the informant, father of the deceased, P.W. 6 during cross-examination has admitted as it appears from paragraph no. 11 of the judgment that the informant implicated the accused persons on the basis of hearsay information but he subsequently came to know that the victim died to diarrhoea.
