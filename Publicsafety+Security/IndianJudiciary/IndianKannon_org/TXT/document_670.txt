The petitioner faces allegations in a crime initially registered under Section 323 and 341 I.P.C. The petitioner had appeared before the learned Magistrate and bail was granted to the petitioner. In the course of investigation, allegation under Section 3(i)(xi) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has also been included. The petitioner, as per interim order issued by this court, was made available before the investigating officer for interrogation. Investigation is now complete. Final report has already been filed. In the final report, allegations under Section 3(i)(xi) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has also been included. The petitioner apprehends that he may be arrested or remanded to custody when he appears before the learned Magistrate.
2. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am satisfied that a direction can be issued that the learned Magistrate must permit the petitioner to continue on bail when he appears before the learned Magistrate on receipt of process in the case registered for offence punishable inter alia under Section 3(i)(xi) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
