Need To Declare ... on 20 November, 2002
NT> Title: Need to declare Parwa-Bori-Sindola-Chandrapur-Gadchiroli-Dhanora-Durg road as National Highway â Laid.
SHRI NARESH PUGLIA (CHANDRAPUR) : After the creation of Chhattisgarh State, there has been a demand for the improvement of Parwa-Bori-Sindola-Chandrapur-Gadchiroli-Dhanora-Durg Road. This particular road is at present upto Sawargaon which is the last border road of Maharashtra in Gadchiroli District. From Sawargaon to Dhanora, the Chhattisgarh Road is in very bad shape. There is a single lane road from Sawargaon to Dhanora. Before Dhanora, there is a 5.5 mtr. road. On this road, there is heavy traffic due to Bhilai Steel Plant and other Ferro Manganese Steel Plant of Chhattisgarh. If the above road is constructed, then the distance will be reduced by 120 Kms. Thus, this will be a national saving in the form of time and fuel. This road will be useful not only for the State of Chhattishgarh but also other States like Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and people of South India. I, therefore, request that the Union Government should take necessary steps for the conversion of this road into National Highway due to its importance.
