                   This       petition        has       been    filed     under
Section 438 Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail in case FIR No.259 dated 8.7.2008 lodged for offences under Section(s) 498-A, 506, 34 IPC, with Police Station, Camp Colony, Palwar, District Faridabad.
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioners have joined the investigation.
Learned counsel for the respondent- State, on instructions from Rajbir Singh, Sub Inspector, states that the petitioners indeed have joined investigation. Rather the complainant has given in writing that she is not interested in Crl. Misc. No. M-24272 of 2008 [2] getting back the dowry articles.
In view of the stand of the respondent, this petition is allowed.
Order dated 18.9.2008 is hereby made absolute and it is directed that in the event of arrest, the petitioners shall be enlarged on bail on furnishing of bail bonds to the satisfaction of the Arresting/Investigating Officer, subject to the following conditions :-
"(i) The petitioners shall make themselves available for interrogation as and when required;
(ii) The petitioners shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer; and
(iii) The petitioners shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court."
This order shall enure till 10 days after the petitioners receive a notice of filing of final report u/s 173, Cr.P.C. within which period, the petitioners would be at liberty to apply for regular bail.
                                                             (AJAI LAMBA)
