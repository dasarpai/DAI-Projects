Madras High Court
Greenvilla Traders, P. Lawrence, ... vs Unknown on 30 January, 2002
Author: P Misra
Bench: P Misra
ORDER P.K. Misra, J.
1. Heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties. Though the matter was listed for considering the question of injunction, since the question involved in the injunction petition is the same matter as stated in writ petition, writ petition itself is taken for disposal with the consent of the counsels appearing for the parties.
2. The petitioner has prayed for Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to permit the petitioner to transport pulp wood (Eucalyptus Hybrid) from Tamil Nadu to Kerala. Learned counsel appearing for the State has relied upon G.O.Ms.No.728 dated 17.8.1978, whereas the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has relied upon subsequent G.O.Ms.No.255 dated 24.11.2000.
3. It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the State that Government Order dated 24.11.2000 was for a period of one year and would not be applicable to the present case as the period was expired. It appears that subsequently the petitioner has filed an application before the respondents 1 & 2 to permit the petitioner to transport pulp wood (Euclyaptus Hybrid) to Kerala as a contract to that effect was entered between the petitioner and the Central Government. It appears further that representation dated 4.12.2001 given by the petitioner was pending before the respondents.
4. Without expressing any opinion on the contentions raised by either parties, I think it is appropriate in the interest of justice to give a direction to the respondents 1 & 3 to dispose of the representation of the petitioner dated 4.12.2001 within a period of two weeks from the date of communication of the order. For the aforesaid purpose, two extra copies of the representation shall be filed by the petitioner for communication to the respondents 1 & 2. Writ Petition is disposed of accordingly. Consequently, WPMP.NO.164 of 2002 is closed.
