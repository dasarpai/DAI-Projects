Ghaziabad Development Authority vs Nahar Singh on 28 September, 2001
ORDER J.K. Mehra, Member
1. The main grievance of Ghaziabad Development Authority is award of interest @ 18% by the for a below. This Commission had considered the question of award of interest against these housing agencies at some length in the case of Haryana Urban Development Authority Vs. Darsh Kumar (Revision Petition No. 1197/98). In the light of that decision wherein we had upheld award of 18% interest, there appears to be no merits in this Petition, which is dismissed.
