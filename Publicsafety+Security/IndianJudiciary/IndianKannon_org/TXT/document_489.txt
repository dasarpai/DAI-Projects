                                             Versus
                                      STATE OF BIHAR
                                           -----------
2. 8.12.2010 The petitioners have sought quashing of the order dated 30.1.2010 passed by the A.D.J., F.T.C.II, Sheohar at Sitamarhi in Criminal Revision No.168 of 2009, by which he has remanded Complaint case No.305 of 2007 to the court of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Sheohar for passing a fresh order in accordance with law.
Since the impugned order is merely an order of remand, I am not inclined to interfere in the matter.
The application is dismissed with a direction to the Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Sheohar to comply with the direction of the revisional court.
