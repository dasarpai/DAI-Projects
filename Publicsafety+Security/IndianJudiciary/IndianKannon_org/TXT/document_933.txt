                     W.P.(C).19624/2009
                         --------------------
             Dated this the 14th day of July, 2009

                         JUDGMENT
Petitioner was a student of B.Tech Degree Course (Information Technology) in A.W.H.College, Calicut. Apparently, dissatisfied with the marks obtained in three papers in the 4th semester examination, June 2008, he had applied for revaluation. He is aggrieved that the result of the revaluation has not been published so far.
2. I heard learned standing counsel for the University also. There is no justification for the delay in the publication of results of revaluation in respect of the 4th semester B.Tech Examination. Ext.P2 application for revaluation is pending before the respondents.
3. Accordingly, writ petition is disposed of directing the respondents to publish the results of the revaluation sought for by the petitioner, as early as possible, at any rate, within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a W.P.(C).19624/09 copy of this judgment provided the application for revaluation is in order and otherwise correct.
V.GIRI, Judge mrcs
