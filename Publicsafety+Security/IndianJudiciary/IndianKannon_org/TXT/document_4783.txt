Hon'ble Raj Mani Chauhan,J.
Hon'ble Virendra Singh,J.
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned A.G.A. for the State as well as perused the record.
This writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the petitioner for quashing the impugned First Information Report dated 06.7.2010 lodged by the Opposite Party No. 4 at Crime No. 300 of 2010, under Sections 323/504/498-A IPC & 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act registered at Police Station Lambhua, District Sultanpur and also for direction to the opposite parties not to arrest him in pursuance of the said impugned First Information Report.
We have gone through the contents of the First Information Report which disclose the commission of cognizable offence and as such there is no ground to quash the First Information Report.
The Writ Petition is, therefore, dismissed.
However, keeping in view the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, it is provided that in case the petitioner appears before the court below and moves any application for bail, the same will be disposed of by the court below expeditiously.
