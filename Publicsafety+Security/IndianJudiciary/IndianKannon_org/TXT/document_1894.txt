                   ====================

                 Dated this the 2nd day of April, 2008

                              J U D G M E N T
Petitioner was a defaulter to the respondents, who had applied for the benefit of One Time Settlement Scheme. The benefit was granted and time for payment was also specified. In this writ petition, what is sought for is enlargement of time for settling the liability in terms of the OTS scheme. This certainly is a matter of contract and has to be decided primarily by the parties to the contract. In view of this, it is necessary that the petitioner should move the 2nd respondent himself.
Therefore, this writ petition is disposed of directing that it will be open to the petitioner to move the 2nd respondent for seeking enlargement of time and if such a representation is made, the 2nd respondent shall consider the same and pass orders thereon within two weeks thereafter. Petitioner may file a representation enclosing a copy of this judgment for compliance.
ANTONY DOMINIC,JUDGE.
