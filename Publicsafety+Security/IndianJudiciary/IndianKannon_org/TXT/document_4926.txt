The complaint of the petitioner is that information sought for by him from the 1st respondent was not forthcoming. It is also stated that he had made Ext.P4 complaint to the 2nd respondent, on which also there is total inaction. This led the petitioner to file this writ petition praying for orders directing the authorities to furnish the information sought for by the petitioner.
On behalf of the 2nd respondent, learned standing counsel submits that they have already forwarded Ext.P4 to the 1st respondent on 12/9/07, with a direction to dispose of the request within 10 days and to report compliance by 27/9/7. The action taken by the first respondent would redress the grievance of the writ petitioner. Therefore, this writ petition is closed.
ANTONY DOMINIC, JUDGE.
