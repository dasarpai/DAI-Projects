                     Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.10277 of 2011
                                      Onkar Kumar
                                           Versus
                              The State Of Bihar & Ors
                              ----------------------------------
2 09/09/2011 The stand of the State has been made known in this case in the counter affidavit which has been filed sworn by the Deputy Director, Mass Education, Human Resources Development Department, Government of Bihar, Patna. Their stand is that the document produced or annexed by the petitioner in support of the authenticity of the marks sheet of matriculation is a forged kind of document not issued by the Bihar School Examination Board. Petitioner had failed in Matriculation examination but he had produced a certificate showing that he had obtained 1st Division.
Even if it is a case of compassionate appointment, if appointment has been obtained based on fraudulent documents or qualifications, then the petitioner cannot be permitted to remain in service even for a day.
Learned counsel representing the Bihar School Examination Board is granted three weeks' time to file counter affidavit with regard to the authenticity of annexure-23 as well as the so called marks sheet of matriculation examination annexed by the petitioner as annexure-13.
Let this matter be listed in the same position on 27.09.2011 for further consideration.
AMIN/                  (Ajay Kumar Tripathi, J.)
