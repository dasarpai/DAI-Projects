 CRIMINAL REVISION APPLICATION NO. 134 of 1997



  CORAM ; N    N   MATHUR, J
 (11.4.1997)


ORDER
In this Criminal Revision Application, the petitioner has made certain allegations against the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Baroda, Court No.1. This cannot be a ground for quashing the order dated 10.4.1997 passed below Exh.23. If the petitioner wants to make out any case on the basis of malafides on the part of the Judicial Magistrate, he may apply for transfer of ithe trial by moving application before the learned Sessions Judge. It goes without saying that the party moving for transfer of case on the ground of bias or imalafides of a Judge makes the same with all seriousness.
Learned Counsel for the petitioner seeks permission to withdraw this Revision Application with a view to approach the learned Sessions Judge. Permission granted. Dismissed as withdrawn.
Date: 11.4.1997(N N MATHUR, J.)
