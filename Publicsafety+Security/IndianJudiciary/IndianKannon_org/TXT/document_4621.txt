KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. (ORAL)
Present petition was filed on 1st November, 1999. No stay was granted.
On January 11, 2005, this Court passed the following order:
"Present: None.
This is a petition for quashing of the FIR. The case is for offence under sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC registered in the year 1998. No stay appears to have been granted in this petition. It may be that the case has since been decided.
Let State of Punjab may check up the position of the case. If the petitioner does not come present on the next date of hearing, the petition shall be dismissed.
Put up on 14.2.2005.

      raghav                                                 Judge"
On February 14, 2005, this Court noticed the contention of the State counsel that charge has been framed and case is pending for trial. However, this position was disputed by counsel for the petitioner. On February 28, 2007, this Court stated that no further adjournment shall be granted and the parties had to appraise this Court about the latest position of the trial. On March 14, 2007, nobody has caused appearance. Today again, counsel is unable to state, status of the trial.
There is no doubt in my mind that by now, trial would have made a headway and it must be near the conclusion.
Therefore, nothing survives in the present petition and the same is dismissed. In case petitioner has any grievance, he will be at liberty to file a fresh petition, giving particulars as to what happened in the trial Court after filing of the challan. All day to day orders passed by the trial Court be annexed with the petition, so filed. The trial Court is directed to conclude the trial in six months, in case trial is already not over.
