                                                 With

                               Cr. Revision No. 750 of 2006
      Gajendra Prasad...............             Petitioners (In both the cases)
                                             Versus
      State of Jharkhand & Ors.............. Opp. Parties (In both the cases)
                                             ......
Coram: Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.K.Merathia    ......
      For the Petitioner                          : Mr. Ananda Sen, Advocate
      For the Opp. Parties                        : Mr. A.P.P.
                                                 ......

      Order No. 4                                                       September 2011
                                                         Dated the 17th
                                                                                      
This   criminal   miscellaneous   petition   has   been   filed   for  restoration of Criminal Revision No. 750/2006, which stood dismissed for  default due to non­compliance of the peremptory order dated 31/07/2008.
Mr. Ananda Sen, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner  submitted that there is 8 days delay in filing this petition.
On this, I heard Mr. Sen, on the merit of the Criminal Revision  No.   750/2006   after   calling   the   records   of   the   same.   He   submitted   that  though the Doctor found injuries but the impugned judgment of acquittal  has been passed only on the basis that the witnesses have turned hostile;  and that the petitioner was not noticed by the learned court below.
In my opinion, no grounds are made out for any interference  with the impugned order, even if, it is accepted that the petitioner has good  grounds for condonation of delay and restoration of the Criminal Revision  No. 750/2006. 
As I do not find any merit in the revision application, both the  cases are dismissed.
           (R.K.Merathia, J) Mukund/­
