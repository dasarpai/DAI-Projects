O R D E R
S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.7298/2007

Date of Order     ::     12th July, 2011   

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MAHESH BHAGWATI

Ms. Neerja Khanna, Counsel for the petitioner 
Mr. Rinesh Gupta, Counsel for the respondents
Mr. Ankit 

BY THE COURT:
Learned counsel for respondents JDA contended that identical writ petitions have already been decided by the Coordinate Bench vide order dated 22nd November 2010 rendered in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 11621/2008 titled as New Raipur Goods Transport Company Versus State of Rajasthan & Others. Hence, this petition may also be decided in the light of the judgment of the Division Bench passed in the case of D.B. Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 5726/2007 (Rajkumar Jain Versus State of Rajasthan & Others).
Learned counsel for the petitioner concedes the fact that similarly situated petitions have been decided in the light of the judgment given by the Division Bench in Writ Petition No. 5726/2007.
Hence, in view of the above, the instant writ petition also stands disposed of accordingly in the following terms:
If the petitioner submits a representation before the respondents along-with the copy of the order dated 9th October, 2007, passed by the Division Bench in the case of Raj Kumar Jain (supra) within a period of two weeks from today, then they shall decide the same within a period of two months from the date of submission before it by passing a reasoned and speaking order in the light of the case of Raj Kumar Jain (supra).
(MAHESH BHAGWATI),J.
