2/12.11.2009
This petition has been filed for seeking mandamus to making an enquiry regarding the residence of Respondent No.6 as he did not reside in the village where the school is situated. It is in utter violence of the guidelines laid down by the government for the appointment of Para-Teacher. The petitioner is the resident of the same village and he fulfills all the criteria. The recommendation made by the committee has not been approved. The petitioner has made representation to the authorities but the representation has not been decided so far.
It would be just and proper to direct the petitioner to file a fresh representation along with the order of this court before D.C.- Respondent No.2 within a period of one month from today and the D.C.- Respondent No.2 will decide the representation by speaking order expeditiously preferably within a period of four months from presentation of the order as well as of the representation to him.
The petition is disposed of accordingly.
No order as to cost.
(J.C.S. Rawat, J.) R.Kumar
