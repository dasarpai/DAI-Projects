He added that as per the direction of the CIC, CPIO had requested the Appellant as well as Shri Sanjeev Kumar Jha, the patient to appear before the Medical Board of the Institute so as to ascertain whether Shri Jha is normal or not so that the information can be furnished to the Appellant on receipt of consent from Shri Sanjeev Kumar Jha. But both of them never turned up before the Medical Board. He added that the medical records of Shri Sanjeev Kumar Jha contain information related to his mental illness, intimate feelings and behaviour, his beliefs, mental status, clinical notes, treatment details etc. He further added that this information is exempt from disclosure to anyone u/s 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(j) of RTI Act, 2005 and also attracts the provision of Indian Medical Council Act, 2002 and Mental Health Act, 1987 for professional misconduct. During the hearing, Dr.Daya Ram also stated that the Appellant is the father of Shri Sanjeev Jha and that he is already aware of the treatment given to his son. When the Commission queried as to why the details cannot be disclosed to a father, Dr.Daya Ram explained that it can be disclosed to anybody with the consent of the patient/authorized attendant or legal authorities involved as per 1.3.2 of IMC Act and documents shall be issued within a period of 72 hours. He also brought to the attention of the Commission that as per para 7.2 of the IMC Act, the physician shall render himself/herself liable for disciplinary action, if he/she does not maintain the medical records of his/her indoor patients for a period of three years as per regulation 1.3 and refused to provide the same within 72 hours when the patient or his/her authorized representative makes a request for it as per the regulation 1.3.2.

When the Commission queried as to whether the case record will be provided in case the Appellant wants to treat his son in another hospital, Dr.Daya Ram clarified that it is possible if the doctor to whom the patient has been referred to makes a request for the case history . The information then will be furnished only to the Doctor and to no one else.
