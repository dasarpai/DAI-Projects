Furthermore, PW.7 is the retired Dy.5.P who has recorded the statement of these witnesses.
10. From this evidence the prosecution intends to establish that the accused 'has committed an offence UfS 198, 419 and 42% ef the . IPC. It is relevant to note that in the transfers certificate at Ex.P.22, the religion, o§,itheh accused has been shown as Hindus and ;;n- colnmni' No.9 as to whether the candidate belongs to SC or ST, the blank is filled in mentioning as 'haidu'. The cumulative record *" .ﬁ§iP.i3" has also been produced which' reveél" that ,the lceste of the accused. has. heeniishcyﬁ~ as Hindu (A.D) to mean Adi--Dravida.t_ i'_ﬁn,P;§~' is the copy of the app3,i}:cstAion "f'i_vi:ed for the post in which the ;V_ accnsed has stated that he belongs to Adi--Dravida Acaste.~ Eg.§L5 is the caste certificate which is it" siened by the Tahsildar, Bangalore North taluk, 3""g in which it is certified that the accused beiongs i'» to Adi--Dravida caste. Ex.?.6 is the form which '°»ﬁfa1so contains the caste as Adi-Dravida and Ex.P.7 i=is the affidavit sworn by the accused stating that he belongs to Adi*Dravida M SC community.§%i:\ I1 signature said to have been forged. If a charge of forgery has to be proved, it is necessary for the investigating agency or the prosecutionf1teW. prove the diesimilarities in the _ei§netere_ by5_f* examining the expert and by eeneing the a§¢gm§ﬁg$§ to the opinion of the expert}: inc §§g§;.efﬁ§:%" has been made at all to :§rove 'theta the hcaete certificate does net_ beer 'the "signatnre~ of the Tahsildar.

It is ireleeantzto mete that whenever a certificate has to he issned by any person, who is authorised in f*»,*law td_iesue, he has to make verification and an 7enqeiry and thereafter has to issue the f=_f°certificate. Leave apart that with regard to the u".enquiry or verification the prosecution has not at all examined the Tahsildar who says that his signature has been forged. In the circumstances, K2 the perusal of the evidence at PWs.1 to 33 does not reveal anything as regards the fdrged signatures.
