Hon'ble Dilip Gupta,J.
The petitioner had appeared at the High School Examination 2010. She is not satisfied with the marks awarded to her and has prayed that all the answer books of the petitioner be summoned.
There is no provision for re-evaluation of answer books. Learned Standing Counsel appearing for the respondents, however, states that the petitioner can approach the Redressal Grievance Committee that has been constituted by the Board by the order dated 1st June, 2010.
In view of the aforesaid, this petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to approach the Redressal Grievance Committee. The Court has no reason to doubt that if the petitioner files such an application before the Redressal Grievance Committee, they shall examine the matter and take an appropriate decision expeditiously.
