Petitioner Krishan Gopal Kalra was married with Punam Kalra on 3.2.1988 according to Hindu rites. Out of this wedlock, a daughter, namely, Mrignalini was born on 25.10.1988. It is alleged that Punam Kalra was thrown out of the matrimonial home and was ill treated for want of dowry. Petitioner-husband had filed a petition for grant of decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion. Ex-parte decree was granted in favour of husband on 12.6.1991. Aggrieved wife filed an application for setting aside ex parte judgment and decree on the ground that fraud was played upon her, as no service was effected upon her. Order of ex parte decree was set aside by the Additional District Judge on 17.2.1998. The present revision petition has been filed against that order.
