F.No.CIC/AT/A/2008/01009 Dated, the 05th January, 2009 Appellant : Shri Arun J. Gedam Respondents : Life Insurance Corporation of India This matter came up for hearing on 31.12.2008 in response to Commission's notice dated 18.11.2008. Appellant was absent, while the respondents were present through Shri S.S. Tembhre, Manager (CRM) & CPIO.
2. It appears from the orders of the CPIO and the Appellate Authority dated 26.04.2008 and 21.06.2008 respectively, that the appellant's RTI-application was not answered as he had failed to remit the application fee of Rs.10/- in the form as laid-down in the Right To Information (Regulation of fee and cost) Rules, 2005.
3. Appellant's second-appeal related to his RTI-application dated 16.04.2008. In his submissions, appellant has stated that non-acceptance of the Court Fee Stamp as token of payment of the RTI-fee by the CPIO was incorrect. He has not stated how it was so.
4. No blame can be placed at the doorstep of the respondents for their adhering to the Rules about the mode of payment of RTI-application fee. The CPIO and the Appellate Authority were fully within their right to insist that appellant comply with the RTI Fee and Cost Rules about the mode of payment of application fee.
5. Appeal fails. Closed.
6. Copy of this decision be sent to the parties.
