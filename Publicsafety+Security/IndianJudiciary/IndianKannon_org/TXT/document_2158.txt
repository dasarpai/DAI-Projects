2 1.9.2010 Issue notice to Gopal Sharma, Son of Jeevan Sharma, Village Amarpur, PS Banka, District Banka as to why his bail bond should not be cancelled in view of the fact that he had surrendered and taken bail in pursuance of the order of this Court dated 13.2.2009 but had not taken steps to file bail bond on behalf of his wife. This Court had granted indulgence and extended the date of surrender of the wife Sunaina Devi petitioner before this Court. Still the husband sat over the order of this Court and now the lady who is the mother of six children is suffering because she has not obeyed the order of this Court dated 13.2.2009 and order dated 24.6.2009.
Gopal Sharma (husband of petitioner) is directed to appear through his counsel in this Court as early as possible or else his wife is in danger of being taken into custody.
List this case on filing of Vakalatnama on behalf of Gopal Sharma.
     Sanjay                                               ( Sheema Ali Khan, J.)
