                 Dated this the 6th  day of February, 2008



                                      ORDER
The main ground on which the petitioner seeks review is that for conduct of smoke house, no Panchayat licence is necessary. It is open to the petitioner to convince the trial court of this aspect. I do not find any warrant for exercising this court's jurisdiction for review of its own orders which is very narrow.
Review Petition will stand dismissed. Learned Munisiff is directed to finally dispose of the suit as already directed in the order dated 04/09/2007 by special listing the suit in the earliest available special list for trial.
PIUS.C.KURIAKOSE JUDGE sv.
