ORAL
ORDER
1.0 Petitioner is aggrieved by a communication dated 22.02.2010, from the Deputy Collector, Stamp Duty Valuation Authority, (City) Division-1, Rajkot, whereby he was informed that his appeal against an order of the Deputy Collector, Stamp Duty was dismissed, as time barred.
2.0 Short facts are as follows:
2.1 With respect to a document registered in favour of the petitioner, the Stamp Duty Authorities assessed and demanded a higher stamp duty of Rs.1,81,890/-, by an order dated 22.03.2003. As per the provisions of the Bombay Stamp Act, the petitioner was required to deposit 25 per cent of the additional stamp duty, while presenting appeal. The petitioner, however, made a request to the appellate authority, either to reduce or to waive, such requirement of pre-deposit. The appellate authority, by an order dated 12.06.2003, permitted the petitioner to deposit only 12.5 per cent of the stamp duty, demanded. It is not in dispute that the petitioner, on the very same, deposited the said amount. Receipt issued by the authorities is produced at Page-31 of the compilation. He also presented appeal memo on 09.07.2003.
3.0 Learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that, when the petitioner had paid the differentiate stamp duty, as required by the appellate authority, on the very same day, his appeal ought to have been decided on merits.
4.0 In peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, when the question of pre-deposit was decided only on 12.06.2003 and when the petitioner had deposited such amount on the very same day, as directed by the appellate authority and also presented appeal memo, within a few days thereafter, in the interest of justice, his appeal ought to have been decided on merits.
5.0 In the result, the impugned communication dated 22.02.2010 is SET ASIDE. The appellate authority shall CONSIDER and DECIDE the appeal of the petitioner on merits. This petition is disposed of, accordingly. Direct service is permitted.
