              B.A. No. 10883 of 2020
                       ------
Altaf Ansari @ Altof Ansari ... Petitioner Versus The State of Jharkhand ... Opposite Party
------
CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR CHOUDHARY
------
For the Petitioner : Mr. S.S. Choudhary, Advocate For the State : Mr. Satish Prasad, Addl. P.P.

Order No.02 Dated- 12.01.2021 Heard the parties through video conferencing. The petitioner has moved this Court for grant of bail in connection with Borio P.S. Case No.71 of 2020 (G.R. No. 132 of 2020) registered under sections 363/366/494/120B/34 of the Indian Penal Code.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner has committed rape upon the victim. It is further submitted that the allegations against the petitioner are all false. It is then submitted that the victim in her statement recorded under section 164 Cr. P.C. has categorically stated that the victim had gone to Kolkata with her husband and the petitioner told the victim that her husband has entrusted the job of killing the informant to the petitioner, thereafter he committed rape upon the victim. It is further submitted that there is a delay in lodging the F.I.R. and admittedly, the maternal uncle of the victim entrusted her to her father at Manjhion Police Station but the case was registered at Borio Police Station. It is next submitted that the petitioner has been in custody since 01.02.2020 as has been mentioned in paragraph no. 9 of the bail application. It is lastly submitted that the petitioner undertakes to cooperate with the trial of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be admitted to bail.
The learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for bail. Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am inclined to enlarge the above named petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Sahibganj, in connection with Borio P.S. Case No.71 of 2020 (G.R. No. 132 of 2020) with the condition that he will cooperate with the trial of the case.
