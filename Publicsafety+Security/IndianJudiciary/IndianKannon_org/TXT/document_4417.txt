            Dated this the 27th day of June, 2008

                            JUDGMENT
The prayer is for refund of the entry tax. The issue is covered in favour of the petitioner by the decision reported in Thressiamma L.Chirayil v. State of Kerala, 2007(1) KLT 303. The learned Government Pleader submits that the matter is now pending before the Supreme Court. But there is no interim order. Therefore, there will be a direction to the respondent to refund the tax collected from the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of production of a copy of this judgment. However, it is made clear that in case the decision of the Supreme Court goes against the petitioner it shall be bound to refund the amount. The question of interest is left open.
The writ petition is disposed of as above.
