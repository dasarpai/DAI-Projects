Basant, J.
We are happy to note that the parties have settled their disputes and filed a joint statement duly signed by the contestants and counter signed by their respective counsel. No further directions appear to be necessary in these circumstances. This Writ Petition is accordingly allowed in terms of the joint statement filed by the parties. Counsel agree that on 22.6.2009 the petitioner shall take the child from the house of the respondent in an autorickshaw to the Port Trust Kendriya Vidyala School and after getting him admitted there, return the child to the house of the respondent on the same day. That submission is also accepted and recorded.
R.BASANT, JUDGE.
