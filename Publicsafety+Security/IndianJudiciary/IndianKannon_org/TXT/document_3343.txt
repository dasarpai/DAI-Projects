This public interest litigation was filed apprehending adverse impact on the environment. In a connected writ petition, by judgment dated 06.07.09 in WP(C) No.12063 of 2009, this Court recorded the submission made by the Company that they had no plans for further development. It would be appropriate to extract paragraphs and 3 of the said judgment.
"2. Learned counsel appearing for the 6th respondent Company submits that they have no plan for development as of now and in case they go for any further development, they will strictly comply with the conditions stipulated in Ext.P7.
3. Learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Kerala State Pollution Control Board submits that before clearance is given for any further developmental activities to the 6th respondent, the Pollution Control Board will see that the WP(C) No. 993/07 conditions stipulated in Ext.P7 are scrupulously followed by the 6th respondent." In the light of the judgment as above, no further orders are necessary in this Writ Petition and it is closed.
S.R. Bannurmath, Chief Justice.
