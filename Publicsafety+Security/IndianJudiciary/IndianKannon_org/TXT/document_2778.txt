AWARD
1. The following Reference from Joint Labour Commissioner was received for adjudication, sent by him U/Sec.10(1)(c) and 12(5) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 read with Notification no.S- 110011/2/75/DK (IA) dated 14.04.1975 and Notification no. F- 1/31/61/616/Estt./2008/7458 dated 03.03.2009 in respect of industrial dispute between the Workman and Management :-
"Whether the services of Sh. Kuldeep S/o Sh. Buddhi Lal, have been terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the Management; and if so, to what relief is he entitled and what directions are necessary in this respect?"
2. Notice of the aforesaid Reference was issued to the Workman and on 05.07.2019, he filed his Statement of Claim before the Court. Thereafter, Notice of said Statement of Claim was issued to the Management, but the Management could not be served due to incomplete/incorrect address and therefore, Workman was directed to file fresh/correct address of the Management for its service. But despite grant of a number of opportunities, the Workman did not file the correct address of the Management. LIR No.256/2019 Kuldeep Vs. M/s. Satkar Terminals Ltd.
Infact he stopped appearing also after 18.02.2020. Vide order dated 11.08.2021, Court Notice was ordered to be issued to him with the direction to file correct address of the Management on record at the earliest. But despite service of said Court Notice and repeated calls since morning, neither anybody has appeared on behalf of the Workman today nor filed the correct address of the Management. Thus, it appears that the Workman is left with no grievance against the Management and therefore, he does not want to pursue his case anymore.
3. Hence, No Dispute Award is passed and reference is answered accordingly. Copy of the Award be sent to Labour Commissioner for publication. File be consigned to Record Room. (Announced in open Court on 09.11.2021) (Navita Kumari Bagha) Presiding Officer, Labour Court-07 Rouse Avenue District Court, New Delhi LIR No.256/2019 Kuldeep Vs. M/s. Satkar Terminals Ltd.
