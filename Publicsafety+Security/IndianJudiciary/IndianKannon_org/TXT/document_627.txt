2 24.10.2011 After some arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner seeks withdrawal of instant petition to permit him to raise the points more particularly with regard to sanctity of evidence of a minor girl aged about four years that too at the time of occurrence in consonance with the other aspect, i.e non- examination by the I.O., non-presentation herself as witness of occurrence along with long lapse of time which is bound to blur the events and simultaneously the opportunity of being tutored.
The petition is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn in the back ground of the aforesaid prayer.
