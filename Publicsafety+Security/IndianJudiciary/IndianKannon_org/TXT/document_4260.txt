Anticipatory bail application filed by petitioners, Smt. Anjani Pandey @ Anjani Devi and Sarsawati @ Guddi Kumari @ Guddi Pandey is moved by Sri Anil Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner and opposed by Sri Suraj Kumar learned counsel for opposite party no. 2.
From perusal of complaint petition, I find that there is dispute between parties for implementation of an agreement for sale. It appears that complainant is not a party to the agreement.
Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstance, I allow this application and direct petitioners, above named, to surrender in the court below by 14th of October 2011. If petitioners surrender by that time, the learned Court below is directed to enlarge them on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Sri M.C.Narayan, learned Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi in connection with Complaint Case No. 2201 of 2009 subject to the condition as laid down under Section 438 (2) of the Cr.P.C.
