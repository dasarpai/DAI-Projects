Mr.
P.M. Thakkar, learned senior counsel at the outset submitted that the total amount involved in the present case is approximately Rs. 6,03,264/- and a co-accused has been released by this Court by order dated 12.03.2010 passed in Criminal Misc. Application No. 1777 of 2010 on condition of depositing Rs.3.00 lacs [Rupees Three Lacs] before the trial court. He further submitted that the applicant is ready and willing to deposit the remaining Rs.3.00 lakhs subject to his rights and contentions that may be raised before the trial court. Considering the aforesaid aspect and the role attributed to the applicant which is reflected in the FIR, he deserves to be enlarged on bail.
Mr.
K.P. Raval, learned Additional Public Prosecutor on the other hand submitted that the applicant is facing charge for the offence punishable under Sections 409, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 114 of Indian Penal Code. Considering the peculiar facts and circumstnaces of the case, the applicant cannot claim parity with the co-accused released vide order dated 12.03.2010 passed in Criminal Misc. Application No. 1777 of 2010. He submitted that considering the role played by the applicant and the manner in which the offence is committed by him, no discretionary relief be granted and the application be dismissed.
I have heard the learned advocates of both the sides at length and in great detail. Having considered the rival submissions and on perusal of the averments made in the application, role attributed to the applicant which is reflected in the FIR, willingness of the applicant to deposit the amount of Rs. 3.00 lakhs [Rupees Three Lakhs] before the trial court, provisions of sections 409, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 114 of IPC and quantum of punishment etc., I am of the view that the applicant deserves to be enlarged on bail without discussing the evidence in detail.
For the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed and the applicant is ordered to be enlarged on bail in connection with CR No. I-60 of 2009 registered with Chuda Police Station, District-Surendranagar, on his his depositing an amount of Rs.3.00 Lacs [Rupees Three Lacs] before the trial court within one week from the date of his release and on executing a bond of Rs.10,000/- [Rupees ten thousand only] with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court and subject to the conditions that he shall:

[f] furnish the present address of his residence to the I.O. and also to the Court at the time of execution of the bond and shall not change his residence without prior permission of this Court;
[g] maintain law and order.
If breach of any of the above conditions is committed, the Sessions Judge concerned will be free to issue warrant or to take appropriate action in the matter.
