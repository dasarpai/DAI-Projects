3. 09.09.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The claim in this writ application to be considered for appointment as the second empanelled candidate after resignation of the first appointed candidate stands fully covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in (2009)4 SCC 555 (Mohd. Sohrab Khan v. Aligarh Muslim University) that the vacancy stood exhausted on the appointment of the first empanelled candidate and her resignation created a fresh vacancy but does not revive the exhausted vacancy.
It is not possible to give relief to the petitioner of the nature claimed.
Needless to state that her case is required to be considered on its own merits in any fresh selection.
The writ application stands disposed.
P. Kumar                                            ( Navin Sinha, J.)
