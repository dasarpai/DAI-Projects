                            ORDER
Petitioner, who is the 10th accused in C.P.No.63/2010 on the file of the J.F.C.M Court, Karunagappally, for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 120(b), 447, 427, 332, 436 and 307 read with 149 IPC, seeks a direction to the said Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail on the date of his surrender itself.
2. Admittedly, non-bailable warrants of arrest are pending against the petitioner. The circumstances under which those non-bailable warrants of arrest came to be issued against the petitioner are not discernible to this Court. It is only proper that the petitioner surrenders before the J.F.C.M.Court, Karunagappally and seeks regular bail. Crl.M.C. No.2179 of 2010 Accordingly, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of permitting the petitioner to surrender before the learned Magistrate and file an application for regular bail within a period of two weeks from today. In case, the petitioner complies with the above condition, his bail application shall be considered and disposed of on merits preferably on the same date on which it is filed notwithstanding the pendency of any non-bailable warrants against him.
Dated this the 18th day of June, 2010 V. RAMKUMAR, (JUDGE) dmb
