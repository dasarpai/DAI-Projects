Petitioner claim that respondent No.4-Sub Divisional Officer, Canal Lining Sub Division No. 15 C.C., Bhatinda, had issued a work order and in pursuance of that he had executed the work to the satisfaction of the respondents but due to acute shortage of funds, payment has not been made to the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that neither there is any defect in the work executed nor any legal impediment in the release of funds.
Issue notice of motion.
On the asking of the Court, Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma, Additional Advocate General, Punjab, accepts notice on behalf of the respondents. Copy of the petition has been supplied to him.
The present writ petition is disposed of by issuing directions to the respondents to release admitted payment to the petitioner, if there is no legal impediment, within three months from the date of receipt of copy of the order, failing which the petitioner shall be entitled to interest on the amount due at the rate of 8% per annum. The interest shall be calculated from the date of amount due till the final payment is made. In case respondents find that the petitioner is not entitled to the payment, they may pass a speaking order detailing the grounds on which the petitioner is not entitled to the payment.
With the observations made above, the present petition is disposed of.
