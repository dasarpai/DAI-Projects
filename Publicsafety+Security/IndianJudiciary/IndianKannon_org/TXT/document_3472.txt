Need To Rehabilitate The People Staying On The Banks Of Yamuna River In ... on 5 June, 1998
> Title : Need to rehabilitate the people staying on the Banks of Yamuna River in Laxminagar, Trans-Yamuna Area in Eastern Delhi.
SHRI LAL BIHARI TIWARI (EAST DELHI) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week two incidents of fire took place in jhuggies on Yamuna Pushta in trans-yamuna area of  Laxmi Nagar.
MR. SPEAKER : Shri Tiwari, you are not sup­posed to read that statement.  
[Translation] SHRI LAL BIHARI TtWARI : Sir, alongwith the financial loss, some lives were also lost in these inci-
dents. Incidents of fire often take place in summer season and people suffer huge loss of life and prop­erty. During rainy season when river Yamuna is in flood these people take shelter on embankment for months and the Government has to spend crores of rupees on them. I request the Government that these people should be settled permanently to some other place to avoid recurrence of such incidents.
