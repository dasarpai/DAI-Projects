W.A No. 330 of 2009
---------------------------------------- Dated this the 12th day of February, 2009 Judgment Koshy, Ag.C.J.
The learned Judge allowed to pay the amount due to the department in four monthly instalments inclusive of interest. It is the case of the petitioner that he will comply with the directions regarding payment of principal amount, but, direction to pay 9% interest is not justifiable. According to the petitioner, there is no provision to pay interest. In the above circumstances, principal amount due to the department may be paid in four equal monthly instalments. With regard to the question of payment of interest, after payment of the principal amount due, respondents can decide the matter with notice to the appellant.
The writ appeal is disposed of.
