Heard the learned counsel for the applicant.
This application has been moved by the applicant for allowing two months more time to repay the amount in compliance of the Court's order dated 9.6.2009.
The learned counsel for the applicant submits that the Court while allowing the bail application of the accused-applicant ordered to repay the sale consideration to the complainant within six months from the date of order. The accused could be released after 40 days from the date of order. He thereafter fell ill and suffered from jaundice, therefore, he could manage the total amount to be paid to the complainant. Now the accused requires two months more time to manage the amount to be paid to the complainant.
The ground shown is sufficient.
The application is allowed. The applicant is allowed two months more time in continuance of the order dated 9.6.2009 passed in Criminal Misc. Case No.3293(B) of 2009 for compliance of the Court's order.
