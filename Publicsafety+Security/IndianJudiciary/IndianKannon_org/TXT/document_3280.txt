1. By this application, the applicant - State of Gujarat has challenged the order dated 8th April, 2011 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track), Ahmedabad (Rural), Mirzapur in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.501/2011 whereby the respondent accused has been enlarged on bail and seeks cancellation of the regular bail granted to the respondent.
2. Heard Ms. C.M. Shah, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the applicant.
3. A perusal of the impugned order indicates that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has considered the nature of the allegations made against the respondent accused and has thought it fit to enlarge the respondent accused on bail. Considering the nature of the allegations made in the First Information Report and the role attributed to the respondent herein, this Court does not find any infirmity in the impugned order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge in enlarging the respondent accused on bail.
4. The application being devoid of merits is accordingly rejected.
