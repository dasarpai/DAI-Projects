This appeal is preferred against the award of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Kottayam in O.P.(MV)23/00. It is for enhancement. A perusal of the award of the Tribunal would show that the claimant had only sustained some minor abrasions and tenderness and the Tribunal had referred to the wound certificate and the medical certificate. It has also considered the medical bills produced in O.P.23/00 which comes to Rs.582/-. So taking note of these factors the Tribunal has awarded a compensation of Rs.5,000/-. There is nothing produced before this Court to show that it needs enhancement or that the compensation awarded is not just and reasonable. Therefore I do not find any merit in this appeal and it is dismissed.
M.N. KRISHNAN, JUDGE.
