          W.P.(C) NOs. 33542 & 33600 OF 2007
          ==========================

         Dated this the 14th day of November, 2007

                        J U D G M E N T
The grievance of the petitioners is that the amount awarded by the MACT, Kollam in OP(MV) Nos.1850/1995 and 1851/1995 have not been deposited by the respondent.
2. Since the award in these cases have become final, I see no justification for the continued delay on the part of the respondent in paying the compensation.
In view of this, I dispose of these writ petitions directing that the amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in the aforesaid awards shall be deposited by the respondent herein, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
ANTONY DOMINIC, JUDGE.
