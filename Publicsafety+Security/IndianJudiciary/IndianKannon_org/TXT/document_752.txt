COMMON ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE V. M. SAHAI) Though only Civil Applications are listed today for hearing, with the consent of the parties, we have taken up the main appeals for final disposal.
2. We have heard Mr. B. Y. Mankad, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Mehul Shah, learned counsel appearing for the respondent.
3. These Letters Patent Appeals have been filed by the appellant - original petitioner challenging the judgment and order dated 21.03.2011 passed by the Learned Single Judge in Special Civil Application Nos.15422 to 15425 of 2010 whereby the Learned Single Judge has issued the following directions :-
"(1) The petitioner - Nagarpalika may file appropriate applications under Rule 26A of the Rules of 1966 before the Labour Court praying for setting aside the ex-parte order, within a period of fifteen days from the date of receipt of this order. It will also open for the petitioner - Nagarpalika to prefer appropriate applications under Rule 26B of the Rules of 1966 praying for stay of the operation of the ex-parte orders till the applications under Rule 26A of the Rules of 1966 are finally disposed of.
(2) The Labour Court, on filing of such applications, shall decide the same in accordance with law after giving opportunity of hearing to the respondents-workmen, within a period of six weeks thereafter.
(3) The Labour Court shall decide such applications which may be preferred by the petitioner - Nagarpalika without being influenced by the present order as this Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the rival claims and contentions."
4. In view of the above directions, since the Learned Single Judge has only directed the appellant to file appropriate application for setting aside the ex-parte order before the Labour Court, we do not find to interfere in the order passed by the Learned Single Judge. It is open for the appellant to raise all the grievances available under the law before the Labour Court and if such applications are filed by the appellant, the Labour Court shall decide the same in accordance with law.
5. With the aforesaid direction, all these Letters Patent Appeals stand disposed of.
6. In view of disposal of main appeals, Civil Applications do not survive and they are accordingly disposed of.
