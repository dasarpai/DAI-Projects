3. In the above circumstances, this writ petition is disposed of directing the M.G.University to complete the revaluation of the answer paper of the petitioner, as expeditiously as possible and at any rate, within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. It is clarified that the above direction is subject to the condition that the application for revaluation submitted by the petitioner is in order and free from any defects.
