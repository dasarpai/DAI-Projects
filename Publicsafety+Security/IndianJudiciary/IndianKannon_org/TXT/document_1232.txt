Central Information Commission Complaint No.CIC/SM/C/2008/00075  Right to Information Act­2005­Under Section (18) Dated: 22 June 2010 Name of the Complainant  : Shri Umeshwar Singh, Social Worker, Gram­ Rampur, Post­ Aaiyara, Dist­ Arwal, Bihar.
Name of the Public Authority   : CPIO, Punjab National Bank, R Block, Chanakya Place,  Patna­800 001.

2. In our notice dated 24 May 2010, we had specifically directed the CPIO to  appear before us in person or through a representative to explain the reasons for  delay.   The copy of the order had been sent to him well in advance.   Nevertheless,  neither the CPIO nor anyone on his behalf turned up today during the hearing.   We  viewed this very seriously.  We could have taken a decision to impose the penalty in  terms of Section 20(1) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act  since he did not think it  necessary to present his views or explanation before us.  
3. However, we want to give him another opportunity to present his case before  us in the matter of delay in responding to the application.  We are fixing the next date  of hearing on 30 July 2010.  The CPIO is directed to appear before us (at Room No. 8,  Club Building, Old JNU Campus, New Delhi) on that date at 11.45 a.m. failing which it  would be presumed that he has nothing to explain in the matter and the penalty in  terms of the above provision would be imposed on the CPIO.   Please note that no  separate notice shall be issued in this regard and this order be treated as the notice  for hearing.    
CIC/SM/C/2008/00075
4. Copies of this order be given free of cost to the parties.
(Satyananda Mishra) Information Commissioner Authenticated true copy.  Additional copies of orders shall be supplied against application and  payment of the charges prescribed under the Act to the CPIO of this Commission.
