                  ------------------------------
               Dated this the 12th day of August, 2009.

                             J U D G M E N T
Heard Sri.C.C.Padmakumar, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Sri.P.Parameswaran Nair, the learned Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing for the respondents.
The first petitioner was a Constable in the Boarder Security Force. The second petitioner is his wife. The first petitioner was proceeded against for unauthorized absence and ultimately by Ext.P6 order dated 30.8.2008, the fourth respondent dismissed him from service with effect from that date. It was also ordered that the period of absence namely the period from 25.7.2007 to 30.8.2008 (403 days) will be treated as `dies- non'. Aggrieved by Ext.P6 order to the extent it directs that the period of absence be treated as 'dies-non', the second petitioner has filed Ext.P7 petition before the third respondent. The second petitioner submits that the first petitioner is undergoing treatment for mental disability and is not desirous of challenging Ext.P6 in toto and that her request in Ext.P7 is confined only to the denial of salary and allowances for the period of 403 days from 25.7.2007 to 30.8.2008. The second petitioner submits that in view of the mental disability of the first petitioner he could not file a petition in time and that the original of Ext.P7 representation was submitted by the second petitioner as the next friend of the first petitioner. The second petitioner submit that it was due to the medical condition of the first petitioner that the delay in filing in Ext.P7 has occurred. In this writ petition the petitioners pray for a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding the third respondent to consider Ext.P7 and pass orders thereon within a time limit to be fixed by this Court.
The pleadings disclose that the first petitioner was dismissed from service on 30.8.2008. Though as per the service regulations, Ext.P6 ought to have been challenged within three months, having regard to the medical condition of the first petitioner and the fact that he challenges Ext.P6 only to the extent it directs that the period of absence from duty shall be treated as `dies-non', I am of the opinion that the third respondent should entertain Ext.P7 appeal as one filed within time and take a decision thereon expeditiously. In view of the fact that the first petitioner is mentally disabled, I also direct the third respondent shall afford the second petitioner a reasonable opportunity of being heard. Final orders in the matter shall be passed within four months from the date on which the petitioners produce a certified copy of this judgment before the third respondent.
