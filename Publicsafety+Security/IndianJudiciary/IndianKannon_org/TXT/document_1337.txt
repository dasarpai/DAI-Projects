ORAL
ORDER
1. Learned counsel Mr. Mukesh H. Rathod, appearing on behalf of the applicant-workmen, states that pursuant to the order passed by this Court dated 09.07.2010, the respondent-authority has made payment to the applicants. He has, however, submitted that the amounts paid to the applicants are less than what the applicants are actually entitled to receive.
2. In proof of the payment made as aforesaid, learned AGP has supplied xerox copies of the receipts, which are taken on record.
3. In view of the above, the order passed by this Court dated 09.07.2010 has been complied with. Hence, no further directions are required to be issued. It is, however, observed that the applicants shall be at liberty to prefer appropriate application before the respondent-authority with regard to the disputed payment, as referred to in the foregoing paragraph and if any such application is preferred, the same shall be decided by the authority concerned, expeditiously, in accordance with law.
4. With the above observations, the applications stand disposed of. Rule is made absolute to the above extent with no order as to costs.
