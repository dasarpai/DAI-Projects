List revised. None appears on behalf of the petitioners.
Earlier the matter was referred to the mediation centre. The report of the medication centre is available on the record which shows that parties have settled their dispute. The parties may file their reports before the CJM concerned, who shall communicate the same to the investigating officer.
In view of the above, this petition is finally disposed of with a direction that the arrest of the petitioners shall remain stayed till submission of the police report.
