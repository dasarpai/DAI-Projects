                       R.P.No.898 OF 2009
                 ------------------------
            Dated this the 29th day of September, 2009.

                              O R D E R
Review is sought on the basis that Annexure-II judgment has been issued without complying with the direction in Annexure-I judgment. A reading of the Annexure-II judgment does not give any indication in support of what the review petitioner submits. Even if what is submitted is correct, it may either be a case to be proceeded under the Contempt of Courts Act or by filing a writ petition challenging the ultimate order which is to be passed. In either of these cases review of the judgment is not warranted.
Review Petition fails and is dismissed.
