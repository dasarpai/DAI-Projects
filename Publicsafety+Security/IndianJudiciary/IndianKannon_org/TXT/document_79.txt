                 W.P.(C) NO. 26028 OF 2007
               ====================

           Dated this the 24th day of August, 2007

                       J U D G M E N T
Petitioner is a Motor Vehicle Inspector, who wanted to get his date of birth corrected. It is stated that he had made Ext.P1 application on 28/11/1992, much before the date of birth was corrected in the SSLC Book. It was only by Ext.P7, that in 1997, correction in the SSLC Book was carried out, pursuant to the orders that were passed in his favour by the Joint Commissioner for Government Examinations. Thereafter, the corrected SSLC Book was produced to correct the date of birth in service records. This was rejected by Exhibits P10, P12 and P14.
Admittedly, by the time he had applied with the corrected SSLC Book in 1997, the time limit specified by the WPC 26028/07 Government in GO(P) No.45/91/P&ARD dated 30.12.1991 had expired. In view of this, no fault can be found in Exhibits P10, P12 and P14 and this writ petition is only to be dismissed and I do so.
ANTONY DOMINIC, JUDGE.
