ORDER Lakshmana Rao, J.
1. The petitioner is the servant of a gun licensee and the Sub-Inspector found the gun of his master with him. The explanation is that he was merely carrying the gun to the house of the master under his orders and the conviction of the petitioner under Section 19(f), Arms Act, cannot be sustained. It is therefore set aside and the fine if levied will be refunded.
