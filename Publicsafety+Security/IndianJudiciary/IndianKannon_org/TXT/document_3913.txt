CORAM: HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE SABINA


Present:   Mr.Gopal Sharma , Advocate,
           for the petitioners.
                 ****

SABINA, J.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ('Cr.P.C.' for short) for grant of anticipatory bail in case FIR No. 221 dated 1.9.2008, under Sections 498-A, 406, 34 of the Indian Penal Code ('IPC" for short), registered at Police Station Beri, District Jhajjar and all other consequent proceedings therein, on the basis of compromise and affidavit (Annexure P-4).
Notice of motion.
At the asking of Court, Mr.Sidharth Sarup, AAG, Haryana accepts notice on behalf of respondent No.1, whereas, Mr.Ajay Chhikara, Advocate accepts notice on behalf of respondent No.2.
Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that in the proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C. parties have compromised their disputes before the Lok Adalat.
Respondent No.2, who is present in person along with her counsel, has admitted the contents of her affidavit (Annexure P-4), wherein she has stated that she has no objection if the FIR in question is quashed.
As per the Full Bench judgment of this Court in Kulwinder Singh and others vs. State of Punjab, 2007 (3) RCR (Criminal) 1052, High Court has power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to allow the compounding of non-compoundable offence and quash the prosecution where the High Court felt that the same was required to prevent the abuse of the process of any Court or to otherwise secure the ends of justice. This power of quashing is not confined to matrimonial disputes alone.
Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of Nikhil Merchant vs. Central bureau of Investigation and another JT 2008 (9) SC "23. In the instant case, the disputes between the Company and the Bank have been set at rest on the basis of the compromise arrived at by them whereunder the dues of the Bank have been cleared and the Bank does not appear to have any further claim against the Company. What, however, remains is the fact that certain documents were alleged to have been created by the appellant herein in order to avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the Company was entitled. The dispute involved herein has overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal facets. The question which is required to be answered in this case is whether the power which independently lies with this court to quash the criminal proceedings pursuant to the compromise arrived at, should at all be exercised?
24.On an overall view of the facts as indicated hereinabove and keeping in mind the decision of this Court in B.S.Joshi's case (supra) and the compromise arrived at between the Company and the Bank as also clause 11 of the consent terms filed in the suit filled by the Bank, we are satisfied that this is a fit case where technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way in the quashing of the criminal proceedings, since, in our view, the continuance of the same after the compromise arrived at between the parties would be a futile exercise."
Since the parties have arrived at a compromise and have decided to live in peace, no useful purpose would be served in allowing these proceedings to continue.
Accordingly, the present petition is allowed. FIR No. 221 dated 1.9.2008, under Sections 498-A, 406, 34 IPC, registered at Police Station Beri, District Jhajjar and all the subsequent proceedings, arising therefrom, are quashed.
