3. 27.10.2010 Heard learned Counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The petitioner seeks bail in a case instituted for the offence under Sections 363, 366A, 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
Considering that the petitioner was involved in immoral trafficking, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner.
Prayer for bail is rejected. The Trial Court is directed to expedite the trial.
Fahad. ( Anjana Prakash, J. )
