                               -----------
02. 03.03.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State.
The petitioner alleges illegal encroachment of Government lands by construction of a Mobile tower by a private service provider, M/s Tata Tele Services Limited on lands identified as plot no. 2656 (old) 75 (new) 67 (gh) (part of plot no. 2656/75) at Mohalla- Rikabganj, Nagar Panchayat- Tekari.
It is submitted that the lands belonged to the Government and were being utilized by villagers for draining water which used to accumulate it in the ditch.
Learned counsel for the State very fairly acknowledges that this cannot be described as drainage in a civil society which requires a proper system of drainage. He further acknowledges that no third party construction can come up on Government lands without proper authorization in accordance with law.
Let the District Magistrate, Gaya examine the contentions of the petitioner and take appropriate remedial action as may be needed on both counts so that citizens did not suffer.
Let appropriate action as found applicable in the law be done within a maximum period of six weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order.
The application stands disposed.
P.K.                                            ( Navin Sinha, J.)
