4. In the result:
(a) The application is allowed.
(b) The petitioner shall be released on bail on the following terms and conditions:
(i) The petitioner shall execute a bond for Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate.
