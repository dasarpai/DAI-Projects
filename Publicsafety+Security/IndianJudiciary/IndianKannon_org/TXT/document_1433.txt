          Dated this the 23rd day of November, 2010

                            JUDGMENT
The petitioners are former employees of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation. They retired from service on 31.3.2010 and 31.3.2009 respectively. In this writ petition the petitioners seek expeditious payment of terminal leave surrender salary on the ground that if the payment of terminal leave surrender salary is delayed they will be put to serious prejudice.
2. Sri.V.V.Nandagopal Nambiar, learned standing counsel appearing for the Corporation, submitted that the Corporation will take steps to disburse the terminal leave surrender salary to the petitioners expeditiously. In the light of the said submission I dispose of the writ petition with a direction to the 1st respondent to take steps to draw and disburse terminal leave surrender salary to the petitioners expeditiously and in any event within two months from the date on which the petitioners produce a certified copy of the judgment before the Managing Director of the Corporation.
P.N.RAVINDRAN, Judge.
