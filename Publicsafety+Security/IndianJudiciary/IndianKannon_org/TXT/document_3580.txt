3. 24.08.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The petitioner seeks bail in a case instituted for the offence under Sections 376/34 of the Indian Penal Code.
Considering that there is direct allegation against the petitioner of having committed rape upon the victim, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner.
The prayer for bail is rejected.
The Trial Court is directed to expedite the trial.
