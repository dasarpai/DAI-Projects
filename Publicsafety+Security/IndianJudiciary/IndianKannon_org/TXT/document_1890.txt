6.i"i--__AccoVr'd_i.ng »-t:o'_.»,.44tVhe prosecution, the accused deci(fie'dfe.to kiii and on 29-O8~2002 on the pretext of .AgettiiigFv.otin'g,child examined by doctor took Naiini on his v>Vi:,,"'r'1V.ero Puch. He proceeded towards Chamundi Hilisanvdi then took a deviation. When Naiini questioned him, V. he-t_oidV"her before visit to hospitai he wants to have darshan '"o.f"Ci':3amundeshwari. But, he took different route from the "foot of the hiil and deviated near Nandi statue towards Uttanahalli Road. On the road he met CW 25 -~ Shivkumar of Shivapura village and when he questioned him, he said he wants to see Nandi Statue.
7. It is alleged at a distance of about from Uttanahalli circle, the accused stopped...thie.ye--h:ic.le asked her to remove mangalasutra, Quyestion'in.g'--._h'e.r'«fidelity and so saying stabbed her cat14_sing«'l'*nji.;'ry tosV»hV*err. fell and then he crushed her withV"a.bou':lder§ and took the child from the spotand tLh'e.%house of his sister CW14--Puttachennamma.__'l' met CW22 * NagarajtrzfCtelotthesaof were stained with blood and blood .stains"tw.ere..V_:lfo.urid on the cheek of the child.

Police Station who was on noticed a dead body lying. He examined and found the dead body was of a woman and head crushed with stone. He appeared before CW3S--Hanumantharayappa and submitted a written report. On which, further action was taken by registering a case in Cr. No. 112/2002.
9. Inquest was conducted on the presence of Cw2--Somashekara, CW3--Manu CW}?i';Viin.'odi'V' by CW34--Hanumantharayappa. B:iood"s.tai'ned«'mijd_,V:b*o'uid'er 9 and other items were seizedfromzithescene' _of'*occui:re--n:ce.u In the meanwhile, CW15--Thin1.nnaiah,"fatheryof twi-ie'V'a'ccused';' went making enquiries as ,i'L"o' =vvi1et'h_er the'*aC'cused had returned with his daug'hte'r--i'n-eiiaw, knew about her whereabioiits."3:'fV§?iow'ever, CW'i7--Vijayan, is said to have informed of a body and accordingly he went.there"=and»id-ent_ifiVe'dV the body as of his daughter--in-- in this mainnerv identity of the dead body was aiso 1Q.."'i:'?.:';3iii:nce the accused had no explanation and he was a person with whom the deceased had gone before her "if"'dea"t'h, investigation was directed against him. During the investigation accused gave voluntary statement, showed /as'.-'-;:/' /.i - v Q/' \/ place of occurrence, lead to recovery of the stone and ciothes were also seized.
11. Considering the evidence on record tendered by the prosecution through its witnesses PW1_g,:to_p*-..28, documents at Ex.P1 to P30 and M05 1 to D6, the learned trial judge convicted the'accdse,d';*~:a'gainst". which he is before us.
3.2. Accused has assailed contending that the prosecutio:n.VV_case'was based on circums_taVntiai%""eviderae' and .§;:her.efore, each circumstance alieged by the 'pro.sje'cu't'ion'v--«wasf required to be established to show it iiicuiipyates Vacculsed and brings nexus between hisgyajctsiiand thecdeathi of his wife--Na|ini. It is urged that no ifevidenﬁceligisjéliaigd by the prosecution to establish any of the ll"circuyn1s'ta"n.ce's;'alleged. In this regard, he contends that the decisioniofv the trial judge is more influenced by the alleged V. exitra--ju'diciai confession said to have been made by the "accused before his sister, whereas the same was retracted if "by him and proved to be a faisity. He has aiso disputed the identity of the dead body as aiso cause of death, whiie the prosecution contends that every circumstance which it canvassed finds favour from the evidence on i'ecord.VVm_'i~.V_
13. Keeping in mind what is examined the evidence on record. It is in- .evide:nce"tha.t the" dead body was recovered by P\fi.{3--\f'og.anarasi'n1ha'iVa'h.. the report of PW3, a case'w.as rVei_:,=..isteredi'v:'at¢:v.i{,,R.iJaaar:i' police station, and inquest was"-,c_onyducted..f_by the Taiuka Executive Magistrate tEf_ief'.p--r_es.e'nce of Somashekar (PW4), Manu (CW3) anode-\.f:i_n'od' inquest, TEM has re:C'orded..i{d_iscd}very'of a of a female with head criished}. "They-aisoj~s\eized..biood stained mud, bouider and other_articie's found at the scene of occurrence. The body sent foVr"'posVt mortem to be conducted by PW8-- in his report, has clearly recorded the injuries fouxndrion the body and its devastating effect. Nine ginjuries found are described as ante--mortem in nature A had caused instantaneous death of the victim. Post rniortem report bears testimony that the death of the woman whose body was recovered, was homicidai. We have no hesitation in accepting the finding of the tria.£__court that the death of the woman was homicidal in
14. The next question is regarding of body. WE have noticed from though the body was recovered by 'Pvt/'3-~Yogaréarasimh;a.i"ahV,:"~by PW10--father of the accused '('i'h:irr1rnaia"h)V_ :i's..'the':§one who has identified the raised any question about identificaVti:on:_o'fft'he by his fatherm Thimmaiah. tofg:oTi'iit.o.Tth'e other incidental issues raised the accused about the Identity/of"theVfciyeadfy4"b0:d'y.Q'h' Henfcféyyéwe affirm the finding of the tria:|»~.,J4:oti_rt' of the woman found by PW3 was that ofiN=aIi'ni,wife~._of*fhe accused. us to the other circumstance.
that accused aiong with his wife and _ daughter_"|eft«:"'the house on the pretext of taking the child to PW10--Thimmaiah has spoken to this aspect. the dispute raised by the accused is with regard to-ftime. During investigation, PWIO states that accused Z1 '\ 2/ 3' V-
ix' /:
9.36 evening, the whereabouts of the accused had :f..tio'ii~i;i,e traced. In this regard, prosecution case is that Vfwtraveiling when he was seen by PW23~Shivai<umar. and the deceased left the house at 7.30 a.m., but during evidence, he states they left at 9.30 am. The discrepancy in his statement with regard to time is highlighted~,':b--y. the accused to show he left the house only at date of the incident and not 7.30 am.
PWIO being father of the animus to the prosecution andtactful:iy'..charliiiffdfjhis with regard to time. Even the accused left along With:'L'~!Ti_E3 it will be of no avail. However, that the fact that accused ,ai'i'd._:,Nalin__i Ieftfiwi'thT"t.hei,r___,daughter together is fully e's_ta'olishe&§.'evelnfr_oin._ the hostile testimony of PW10-- Thimmaitahﬂi *Wh"at later is of importance. 16; Pros'e'c'ut,io__nevidence shows accused had travelled 'w'i'tih,the'decéased on motorcycie and thereafter returned to elder sister-PW9 (Puttachenamma). From accutsed having taken a deviation to Chamundi Hills, was 45' -.-"\._\' 3 .» ' 4'/' /V 5 it w »'v I0 Therefore, PW23's version that he had seen the accused is one circumstance, but Shivakumar turned hostile. However, the evidence of PW2--Rajesha pawn brohkegr, is important. Prosecution has proved that the pledged mangalasutra of Nalini with Rajesphlaindv V' Rs.5,00G/-. While the prosecution all|'eg'e_s7;afterticommitting the murder of Nalini, accused went to thelglsuhpﬁ, Rajesh and pledged the j'v'*'¥l:"éi--n9a|su'tf.5'l">a.nd7,"collected Rs.5,000/-, the conten"ti.on ovi*"'th'e,'j4aVc"cu._Sed is'"'th'at he had gone to the shop of Rajelshpeiiehgi'i3;a'li_s'.:ii and the child. In other word:s,"it;h'e. alliegatioin 'oAfA"t.ij';'~e.,prioslecution that after killing 1'-.__Naiini,V"'a:cuse'd«._:"rvemoved her mangalsutra and pledged itgwiith 'Raj'esh..lfithiis is sought to be negated by point.;in'g out th'atV_the accused had actually gone with Naiini hence, she was alive. In fact, Rajesh-PW2 ih:'a\}ing accepted the pledge of mangalsutra for Rs.'5",«OOf)/F-ifirom the accused, but he tried to change his 3 _"version"b§/ saying accused had come along with a woman child. The prosecution declared him hostile and he
-could not stand the test of crosswexamination, as he could not reveal who was the woman who had accompanied the accused, nor could he describe her or testify it was the deceased. Since accused has admitted having pledged mangalsutra with Rajesh, prosecution has incriminating circumstance and we also fi'n,dCtha't the evidence of PW2--Rajesh substentieiiiy"s'u..p'por-:ts.n,pi-eeecumin case regarding pledge of mangalsutraand so with regard accused being ac'c4o:Vm.panied._by»i\ia|i'ni and her daughter.
17. The evidence-1'1off'E"P'W9;Pu'§t,ac.henamma was brought in accused had, after co__mmittVin'g,-th4e<m'u.rder of Nalini, taken his daughter to the house-.of~PW'9 ..h"ad4guestioned him after seeing the bloo,d's'L'ains face of the child and on his clothes. It furthe_r"'a_lV|eged by the prosecution that accused had i"'ma5f_1_e.lAe;tt'r'aV_--ju'VdVi'cia| confession before PW9--Puttachenamma about co'rrumf'ission of the murder of Nalini. However, PW9 :_"resc.inded" the statement and denied accused had made such sta'teu*nent. But the fact remains, he had visited the house .',;
"\./ of PW9 with the child and not Nalini. To this extent, PW9's evidence supports the prosecution case.
18. We do not wish to deal with t'hV'e~~..f"--«oTther circumstances which are incidental. Howeverg:the.i«fa'ct"it.h"atH the accused left the house in the-"r'co.mpa_:nylVV'4oifi-».|a'iin_ij_aiidiu' faiied to explain what transpired' hekt-opol-gt important. His explanationV'is:_a'i=z.¢ visited 'thle-.:slho'p'~ioiF PWZVLV aiong with Nalini and after pledﬁ"i"nq"'her mangalsutra, gave her Rs.5,000/- and then' 'p.arte.d_:herzcotmpany. If we beiieve such version, then thewa'c'cuse'd««.:h.as explained how it came to_his:?p'os:s'esSion he visited the house of his sist'ei~.P.W9_. : 'fhe_r'e«.._:il's-,_:therefore, no expianation as to where_VNalin'i» had VgonAe_»after the aiieged parting of company. a.ccuse"disiicontending he had parted the company OfNaiitI'l,:b.i4J'l'(lé"¥i was on him to estabiish this aspect. VA 19..'H'o*w;ever, this version has to be tested from other attending circumstances. The other attending "'--"_circij'mstances are, clothes of the accused were found to be pﬁiood stained; his clothes aiong with biood stained bouider i i '\ /' I3 and wearing apparel of the deceased were seized by the investigating officer. Knife--M.O.5 is said to have been recovered at the instance of the accused. Ali thesueVVca_r'tci.c_|es were sent for chemical analysis by PW28--Dr.Na'nj'und.a_ppa".«_ He has in his report at Exs.P29 and P30 affir.m:e,d'sierologlyv report that M.O.1~size stone, sar.jple...;rifud;.gsar'ee,'=Vb-i_ou::;ver. brassier of the deceased andshirt ofV"th_e" accu.se'd_rapVart_:'§frorn':"r. undergarments marked as to have human blood stains. "o_thérs_ were found to be stained with blood grou.pg'_O.f. that the blood group of the i_dec;:rg.a'se.d:'-éwia_s"'Of an'd"t~he same group was found on t_heAVVboui'id_Vei<,gg shirt of the accused. This was a clincher to 'bringirnéelxus between the acts of the accuééd and dleatlhvlof :Nalini. If the accused was not the author o'i".Ai.i:3"us=i.es caused to the person of Nalini, burden was "toA"'_eV;<pV.l:ai'n how blood stains of the same group as that"of his wife Nalini were found on his shirt. Though the ..g.acc,ugsedV"tried to put defence, it was found evasive and not 'o'f_the" nature to negate incriminating aspect emerging from
-the serology test performed on the bfood samples. The 1"'.
learned trial judge has accepted this part of the prosecution evidence to bring nexus between the acts of the accused and homicidai injuries found on the person of the dvegceased.
20. We do not find any error in assessr_h'eht'.i'gof' t:h_e_ evidence discussed by the trial codgrt to _i'1'o'l'd~~~1it'i.ir1'cu'ipat.es'~. the accused. However, the contenitiorg"'of:'the._accusé'd:"ii--s that he was a loving husband_'and their Vmav:r'riAag.e_vvasA consequence of love affair wh_i_ch_couid no-tmakfe him the assailant.

We do not find any reason to disbelieve their version that the deceased had spoken about the suspicionfjin the mind of the accused.
