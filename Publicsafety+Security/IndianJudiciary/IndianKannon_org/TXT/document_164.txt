The petitioner has approached this Court, praying inter alia, challenging the appointment of the 4th respondent as Chief Engineer, in the Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA) and also seeking a direction to respondents 1 to 3 to convene DPC and to prepare select list for promotion to that post. This Court on 31-5-2007 passed the following interim order.
"Heard. Respondents 2 and 3 are directed to consider whether they propose to fill up the post of Chief Engineer in the TRIDA within one month from the date of production of a copy of this order and if it is decided to fill up the post, the DPC shall be convened and a panel shall be prepared for the same within two months thereafter."
In view of the above position, the Writ Petition is disposed of making the said interim order absolute.
