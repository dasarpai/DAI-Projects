Allahabad High Court
Raj Kumar And Another vs State Of U.P.And Others on 10 May, 2010
Court No. - 38

Case :- WRIT - A No. - 7606 of 1994

Petitioner :- Raj Kumar And Another
Respondent :- State Of U.P.And Others
Petitioner Counsel :- Sudhir Kumar
Respondent Counsel :- S.C.

Hon'ble Ran Vijai Singh,J.
List has been revised. No one appears for the petitioner. Learned standing counsel appears for the State respondent.
Through this writ petition the petitioner has challenged an order of suspension passed under contemplation of disciplinary inquiry. The reason for which the petitioner has been placed under suspension appears to be serious in nature, therefore, I am not inclined to interfere with the suspension order as the suspension is not a punishment and the petitioner will have every chance to rebut the charges levelled against him during disciplinary proceeding. Otherwise also more than sixteen years have passed disciplinary proceeding must have come to an end.
In view of that, I direct that in case the disciplinary proceeding has yet not been concluded the same may be concluded as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of three months. The petitioner is directed to cooperate with the inquiry.
Subject to above observation, the writ petition is dismissed.
Order Date :- 10.5.2010 Pratima
