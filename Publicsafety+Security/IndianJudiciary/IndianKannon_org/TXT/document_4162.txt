Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned A.P.P. for the Prosecution.

From the FIR, it appears that the police was informed that the petitioner was involved in demanding rangdari from the D.O. Holders and on the said information, the police raided the house of the petitioner and arrested the petitioner from his house.
