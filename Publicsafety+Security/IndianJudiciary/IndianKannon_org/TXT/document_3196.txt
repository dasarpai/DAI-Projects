> Title : Need to exempt Handloom Weavers Co-operative Societies from the payment of ESI contribution.
SHRIMATI  P. SATHEEDEVI (BADAGARA): Sir, the UPA Government in its Common Minimum Programme has given an assurance that the traditional industries of the country will be protected. The handloom weavers cooperative societies of the country are facing a huge crisis because of the policies adopted by the Central and State Governments. Now the rebate facilities enjoyed by these societies are also stopped and these societies are facing financial crisis. Majority of these societies have even failed to pay the ESI contribution and now they are facing revenue recovery proceedings. Hence, I urge upon the Ministry of Textiles to provide a separate fund for the payment of arrears of the ESI contribution of handloom cooperative societies and these societies may be exempted from the payment of ESI contribution.
