The complainant had filed an application with the PIO on 26/03/2009 asking for certain information. She received a reply from the PIO, which he found unsatisfactory. The complainant has therefore filed a complaint with the Commission under Section 18 of the RTI Act, 2005. The complainant has not used the alternate and efficacious remedy of First Appeal available under Section 19 (1) of the RTI Act. Consequently, the First Appellate Authority has not had the chance to review the PIO's decision as envisaged under the RTI Act.
Therefore, the matter is remanded to the First Appellate Authority with a direction to decide the matter in accordance with the provisions of the RTI Act, after giving all concerned parties an opportunity to be heard.
The Complaint is disposed.
Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the parties.
