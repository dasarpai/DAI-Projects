Petitioner claims to be in possession and ownership of 10.71 cents of property comprised in Re.Sy.No291/8 of Peringara Village. According to her, there is a footpath on the northern side of the property having an average width of 2 feet leading to her residential property. She has sought for correction of resurvey plan and apparently a request has been made in the wake of an order passed by the Civil Court rejecting the claim of the petitioner in relation to pathway situated on the northern side of the property. Ext.P1 is pending orders and this writ petition has been filed seeking appropriate direction in relation to Ext. P1. Second respondent shall consider whether Ext.P1 is maintainable and if it is maintainable then notice shall be issued to the opposite parties in the suit filed by the petitioner in O.S 543/2003 and 544/2003 before the Munsiff's Court, Thiruvalla. Thereafter a decision shall be taken on Ext.P1 after hearing such opposite parties in O.S W.P ( C) No.22741 of 2009 543/2003 and 544/2003 within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment Writ petition is disposed of as above.
