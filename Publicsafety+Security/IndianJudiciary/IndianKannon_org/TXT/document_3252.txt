ORAL ORDER
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE M.S.SHAH) Rule. Mr RC Kodekar, learned APP waives service of Rule for the respondents. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the application is taken up for final disposal today.
This is an application for extension of temporary bail on the ground that the convict's father is suffering from cancer.
In view of the fact that the convict has by now completed 2 years of imprisonment, the convict is due for furlough leave. However, the applicant who is present before the Court states that that procedure will take some time, but the applicant's father requires one son to attend to him, over and above, the applicant's mother who is also released on temporary bail.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, the period of temporary bail is extended till 10th November 2005. The applicant shall accordingly surrender before the jail authority on 10th November 2005 by 5.00 PM.
Rule is made absolute.
While sending a copy of this order to the Jail Superintendent, Sabarmati Central Prison (for which Direct service is permitted), a copy of this order shall also be sent to the Police Officer, in charge of Dholka Police Station.

SHAH, J.)            (D.H. WAGHELA, J.)
