                              Central Information Commission
                       File No.CIC/SM/A/2009/001023 dated 29足01足2009
                  Right to Information Act足2005足Under Section  (19)



                                                                     Dated: 12 May 2010



Name of the Appellant                  :   Shri Anupam Sharma
                                           Purana Baraf Khana,
                                           Near Railway Crossing,
                                           Uswan Road, Budaun.


Name of the Public Authority           :   CPIO, State Bank of India,
                                           Local Head Office,
                                           Lucknow.


        The Appellant was present in person.

        On behalf of the Respondent, Shri S. Mitra was present.
  2. In this case, the Appellant had, in his application dated 29 January 2009,  requested the CPIO, Tikatganj to provide him copies of documents in regard to  a number of queries regarding the role and responsibility of the guarantor in  loan   cases  etc.   In   his   reply   dated   24   February  2009,   the   Branch  Manager  offered several clarifications/explanation/information against these queries. Not  satisfied with the reply of the CPIO, the Appellant preferred an appeal. The  Appellate Authority disposed of the appeal in his order dated 22 April 2009 in  which he directed the CPIO to provide the desired information along with copies  of the relevant circulars/rules. Reportedly, the CPIO, in compliance of these  directions,   had   sent   the   desired   information   to   the   Appellant   in   his  communication dated 5 May 2009. Now the Appellant has come to the CIC  alleging that he had been provided with wrong information and that the Branch  Manager should be punished for that.
CIC/SM/A/2009/001023
3. We   heard   this   case   through   videoconferencing.   The   Appellant   was  present in the Badaun studio of the NIC while the Respondents were present in  the Lucknow studio. We heard their submissions. Although the Appellant had  not framed his requests very clearly, nevertheless, it is quite obvious that the  Appellant had sought copies of the circulars/guidelines on sanction of car loan  in  general and  about his  own  loan case  in  particular.  In fact,  the Appellate  Authority had already directed the CPIO to provide the copies of all the relevant  rules and regulations covering the queries of the Appellant, which it seems he  did not provide. Therefore, we now direct the CPIO to provide to the Appellant  within 10 working days from the receipt of this order, (a) the relevant rules and  regulations laying down the eligibility criteria and the documentation details for  availing of car loan and (b) the photocopy of the relevant records of the Branch  showing the reasons for the rejection of his car loan application.
4. We   have   noted   that   the   Appellate   Authority   had   observed   that   the  Branch Manager had disposed of the requests for information even though he  was   not   authorised   to   do   so.   If   he   was   not   authorised   to   deal   with   such  requests, he should have transferred the application promptly to the designated  CPIO. We would expect the CPIO to advise the Branch Manager concerned  suitably so that he does not repeat the mistake in future.
5. With the above directions, the appeal is disposed off.
6. Copies of this order be given free of cost to the parties.
(Satyananda Mishra) Information Commissioner CIC/SM/A/2009/001023 Authenticated true copy.  Additional copies of orders shall be supplied against  application and payment of the charges prescribed under the Act to the CPIO of this  Commission.
