                                          -----------
3. 7.7.2008 Heard.
Petitioner was found in possession of a country made pistol as per description along with ammunitions while the police was on a look out of an accused in a particular case, considering which I am not inclined to direct release of the petitioner from custody. The petition is dismissed.
However, as soon as petitioner completes one year in custody in Nagarnausa P.S. case no.12 of 2008 from the first day of his remand in that case, he will be released from custody by Sri P.C. Pandey, Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Hilsa, Nalanda, on furnishing bond to his own satisfaction.
