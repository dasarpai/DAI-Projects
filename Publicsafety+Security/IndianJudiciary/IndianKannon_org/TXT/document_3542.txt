Orissa High Court
WP(C)/446/2020 on 9 January, 2020
                               W.P.(C) No.446 of 2020




02.   09.01.2020         Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
                         This writ petition involves implementation of
              the direction of the Tribunal involving O.A. No.257(C) of
              2019 disposed of on 13.02.2019.
                         For the grievance involving implementation
              of the direction of the Tribunal, this Court disposes of
              the writ petition directing the Collector, Nayagarh,
              opposite party no.2 to work out the direction of the
              Tribunal dated 13.02.2019 passed in O.A. No.257(C) of
              2019, by taking effective steps within a period of one
              month from the date of communication of this order by
              the petitioner, if there is no legal impediment. Non-
              compliance of this order will amount to initiation of suo
              motu contempt proceeding against opposite party no.2.
                         Issue urgent certified copy as per rules.
