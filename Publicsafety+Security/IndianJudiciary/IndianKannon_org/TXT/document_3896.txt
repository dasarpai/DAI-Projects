3. 21.09.2010 Heard learned Counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The petitioner seeks bail in a case instituted for the offence under Sections 414 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25 (1-B)a 26/35 of the Arms Act.
Considering that the petitioner has criminal antecedent and from his possession arms were recovered, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner.
Prayer for bail is rejected. The Trial Court is directed to expedite the trial and conclude it positively within a period of 1 year.
Fahad. ( Anjana Prakash, J. )
