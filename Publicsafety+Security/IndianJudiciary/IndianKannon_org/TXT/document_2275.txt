ORDER
Grievance of the petitioner is that though he has filed complaints before the Police alleging commission of offence punishable under Indian Penal code, the same is not registered as FIR. No action is taken to investigate.
Under the circumstances, it would be open for the petitioner to file a complaint in writing to the concerned Magistrate. If such a complaint is filed, the learned Magistrate shall examine and pass such order as found necessary as expeditiously as possible.
With above observations, petition is disposed of. Direct service is permitted.
