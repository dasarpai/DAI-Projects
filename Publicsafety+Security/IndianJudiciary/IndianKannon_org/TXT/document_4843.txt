                                 ORDER
Petitioner, who is the 1st accused in Crime No.617/2010 of Palakkad Town South Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 323 and 498A I.P.C., seeks anticipatory bail.
2. The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application.
3. Anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of this nature. But at the same time, I am inclined to permit the petitioner to surrender before the Investigating Officer for the purpose of interrogation and then to have his application for bail considered by the Magistrate having jurisdiction. Accordingly, the petitioner shall surrender before the investigating officer on 3.12.2010 or on 4.12.2010 for the purpose of interrogation and recovery of incriminating material, if any. After interrogation, petitioner shall be produced before the Magistrate concerned who on being convinced that the petitioner has been interrogated by the police, shall release the petitioner on bail on the petitioner executing a bond for `15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the Magistrate and subject to the following conditions:-
1. The petitioner shall report before the Investigating Officer between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Wednesdays.
2. The petitioner shall make himself available for interrogation including custodial interrogation as and when required by the Investigating Officer.
3. Petitioner shall not influence or intimidate the prosecution witnesses nor shall he attempt to tamper with the evidence for the prosecution.
4. Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.
5. If the petitioner commits breach of any of the above conditions, the bail granted to him shall be liable to be cancelled.
This petition is disposed of as above.
V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE sj
