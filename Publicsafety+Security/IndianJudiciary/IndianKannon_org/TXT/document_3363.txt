Let the learned court below issue notice to the complainant and on her appearance the petitioner will take back the complainant to her matrimonial home to keep the complainant as wife with full dignity and honour.
Let the learned court below confirm the provisional bail of the petitioner on substantial restoration of conjugal life or if the complainant deliberately refuses to reside with the petitioner. U. K. ( Dinesh Kumar Singh, J)
