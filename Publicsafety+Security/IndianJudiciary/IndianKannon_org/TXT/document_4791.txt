             Dated, this the 6th day of January, 2009

                           J U D G M E N T
The petitioner is a medical student of MES Medical College, Perinthalmanna. By submitting Ext.P1, she has applied for revaluation of the first year papers mentioned therein. In this writ petition, she complains that although application was made as early as on 23/12/2008, the University has not revalued the answer papers as sought for or declared the results on that basis.
2. I heard the learned standing counsel appearing for the respondent University, who offers to complete revaluation of the answer papers applied for by the petitioner within eight weeks from today, provided the application made by the petitioner is otherwise in order. I, record the submission of the learned standing counsel and direct that the revaluation be completed and results declared as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within eight weeks from today.
The writ petition is disposed of as above.
