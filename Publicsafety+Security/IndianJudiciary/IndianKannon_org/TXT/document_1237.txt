The petitioner is aggrieved by the orders Annexures P5 issued by respondent No.3, vide which a show cause notice has been issued to the petitioner to show as to why her services be not terminated because one Ramandeep Kaur had also appeared in interview along with the petitioner but in the resolution passed by the Panchay at she was not shown to be handicapped.
Since only a show cause notice has been issued to the petitioner, therefore, she may respond to the said notice, which may be considered in accordance with law by the competent authority.
It is made clear that the decision on the show cause notice shall be taken strictly on merits and not by pre-determined mind.
The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly.
