Learned Government Pleader submits a portion of the amount due to the petitioner has been disbursed. I record the submission of the learned Government Pleader that a reply will be given to the petitioner within six weeks from today, showing the quantum of the amount and the reasons, if any, for not disbursing to the petitioner the entire amount as claimed by him. It is open to the petitioner to pursue his remedies thereafter, before the Department or the Government, if he is not satisfied with the quantum of the amount.
Subject to the above, Contempt of Court case is closed.
