ASHUTOSH MOHUNTA, J. (Oral)
The petitioner is aggrieved by the award of 1 mark out of 315 marks in the entrance examination for AIEEE-2008.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner had secured 88.6% marks in the marticulation examination, conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education and also secured 77.2% marks in her 10+2 examination. However, in the entrance examination for AIEEE- 2008, she has been awarded 1 mark out of 315 marks. It is submitted that there seems to be some mistake in awarding the marks to the petitioner in the entrance examination for AIEEE-2008.
Mr. Aggarwal, Counsel appearing for the Board, argued that the question paper in the entrance examination for AIEEE was of objective type and there was a system of negative marking. He submits that due to the negative marking, the petitioner has secured only 1 mark out of 315 marks. He has also shown us the answer sheet of the petitioner. A perusal thereof, shows that the candidates were given OMR sheet and the answers attempted were scanned through computer and accordingly, the marks were awarded. Because of the negative marking in the objective type question paper, the petitioner secured such low marks. We find nothing wrong with the marking done in the case of the petitioner.
In view of the above, there is no merit in the writ petition and the same is dismissed.
