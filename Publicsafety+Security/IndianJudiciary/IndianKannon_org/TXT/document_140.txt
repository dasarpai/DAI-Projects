Jharkhand High Court
Manjit Nag vs State Of Jharkhand & Ors on 22 July, 2011
      IN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI
                              Cont. (Cv.) No. 654 of 2010
  Manjit Nag.......................                               Petitioners
                            Versus
  State of Jharkhand & Anr  ......                         Opp. Parties 
                            ......
Coram:  Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.K.Merathia    ......
For the Petitioner   : Mr. Kripa Shankar Nanda, Advocate  For the Opp. Parties  : Mr. Rajesh Shankar, SC足I ......
Order No. 5       Dated 22    July 2011 nd     It   is   submitted   by   Mr.   Nanda,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the  petitioner   that   though   the   concerned   respondent足Director,   Primary  Education, Jharkhand, Ranchi, has taken a fresh decision in terms of the  order in question but such decision is wrong and moreover the time was  given for taking such decision within three months but it was taken after  more than one and half years.
On the other hand, Mr. Rajesh Shankar, learned counsel for the State  referring to the show cause submitted that  a thorough enquiry was made,  which   took   some   time   and   the   petitioner   was   also   given   opportunity   of  hearing   on  22/05/2010   and,   therefore   there   was  delay   in  complying   the  order in question, which may be condoned.
Thus,   it   appears   that   the   order   has   been   complied   by   taking   a  fresh decision though  much beyond the time limit, which has been sought  to be justified.
In the circumstances, this contempt case is dropped with liberty  to the petitioner to   avail appropriate remedy as may be available to him  under the law, against the order dated 11/06/2011, passed by the Director,  Primary   Education,   Ranchi,   Jharkhand,   contained   in   Annexure足A   to   the  Show Cause.
