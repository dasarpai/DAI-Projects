2/6.11.2009
This is an application for restoration of L.P.A No.196/2004, which was dismissed on account of non-appearance of the counsel for the appellants.
It has been stated that the appellants' counsel had to suddenly go to Vellore in connection with the treatment of his 13 year old son and in the state of mental agony, he could not make an alternative arrangement in his place and instruct any one to take care of the matter, which was running on the Board.
Taking into consideration the hardship of the counsel for the appellants, we take a lenient view of the matter and restore the aforesaid appeal to its original number, to be heard on merit. This application for restoration is allowed and disposed of.
