> Title: Need to look into the problems being faced by people living along the international Border.
  CHAUDHARY LAL SINGH (UDHAMPUR): There is great injustice being meted out to the people living in border areas.  The Home/Defence Departments are using the land of local people for the security purposes.  But both the Departments have not given any compensation to them.  Both the Departments have constructed hi-tech fencing, tracks and check-posts.
            I, therefore, request through this House to the concerned Departments to give adequate compensation to the people whose lands have been acquired for the aforesaid purpose.
