After arguing for some time, the learned counsel for the petitioners seeks permission to withdraw these writ petitions without prejudice to the right of the petitioners to seek reliefs before the Board itself in accordance with Order No. LA(S)IV/10032/2005 dated 2.9.2005, which, according to the petitioners, is an order granting reliefs to similarly placed persons. Without going into the merits of the contentions of the petitioners on the basis of the said order, these writ petitions are dismissed as withdrawn without prejudice to the above right of the petitioners.
