Petitioner :- Ashutosh & Others

Respondent Counsel :- Govt. Advocate

Hon'ble Amar Saran,J.
Hon'ble S.C. Agarwal,J.
A restoration application has been filed seeking recall of order dated 31.8.2009 dismissing the writ petition for want of prosecution. The ground for absence of learned counsel for the petitioners was that his clerk could not mark the case on the cause list.
The ground is sufficient. The order dated 31.8.2009 is recalled and the writ petition is restored to its original number. Interim order granted earlier is also restored.
Learned counsel for the petitioners states that the petitioners and respondent no.4 have compromised their dispute before the Mediation centre, High Court, Allahabad and the respondent no.4 is residing with the petitioners. He prays for listing of this case on 19.7.2010.
In this view of the matter, list this case on 19.7.2010.
The interim order granted earlier to continue till the next date of listing.
Order Date :- 14.7.2010 sfa/
