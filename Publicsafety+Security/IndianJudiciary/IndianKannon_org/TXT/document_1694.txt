                           W.P.(C) No.20014 of 2010
                          --------------------------------------
                     Dated this the 28th day of June, 2010.

                                    JUDGMENT
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 appear through counsel.
2. Petitioner who is additional appellant No.3 in A.A.No.14 of 2001 of the Land Tribunal, Thripunithura seeks a direction to that authority for early disposal of S.M.P.No.257 of 1998 (S.M. No.67 of 1997 of the Land Tribunal, Vypin). Since the proceeding was not disposed of respondent Nos.5 and 6 filed W.P.(C) No.14133 of 1999 and got an order for time bound disposal. But that was not complied. Respondent Nos.5 and 6 filed C.C.C.No.252 of 2001. While so, Land Tribunal disposed of S.M.Proceedings on 13.06.2001 which was challenged by respondent Nos.5 and 6 in A.A.No.14 of 2001. Appellate Authority on 23.02.2007 set aside the order and remanded the proceeding to the Land Tribunal for fresh disposal after hearing the parties. Grievance of petitioner is that from 18.05.2007 the matter is again pending before the Land Tribunal but, without passing final order. It is when the appeal was pending that petitioner got himself impleaded in the appeal as well as S.M.Proceedings. It is seen that the proceeding is pending from 1997 onwards. In the facts and circumstances of WP(C) No.20014/2010 the case I direct the Land Tribunal to dispose of the S.M.Proceedings as expeditiously as possible taking into account the fact that the matter is pending from 1997 onwards.
Writ Petition is disposed of as above.
THOMAS P.JOSEPH, Judge.
