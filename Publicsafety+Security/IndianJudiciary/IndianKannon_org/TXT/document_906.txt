8. In the present case, the contention of the appeilant corrsieteetiy was to the effect that along with the ériver of the vehicle, the owner of the goods also traveller} because the consignor ei:ide.the consignee were one and the same.

9. It is also not disputed by the revenue that in View ef the notice sent by the check~post offieer pertaining te M/e. Vivek Petra, investigation was :1 made with regard to the accounts of M15. Vivek Petro and even intelligence wing of the revenue also made a thorough investigation both at Marzgalore and Pondieherry, so far as the Business , Vivek Petra.
