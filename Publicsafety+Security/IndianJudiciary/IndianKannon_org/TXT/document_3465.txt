                                 JUDGMENT
Learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent submits that the said respondent has not caused any threat to the life of the petitioner. The petitioner has in fact cheated the 4th respondent, it is submitted. It is also submitted that the 4th respondent has filed a complaint before the Commissioner of police as Ext.R4(e). Be that as it may, in view of the submission that the 4th respondent does not intend to cause any difficulty to the petitioner's peaceful life, the Writ Petition is disposed of making it clear that in the event of any threat to the life of the petitioner, it will be open to him to approach the police in which case the police will take appropriate action to see that law and order is maintained. However, we make it clear that the judgment shall not stand in the way of the police discharging their statutory duty of enquiring into or investigating any complaint or case in which the parties are involved, in accordance with law.
