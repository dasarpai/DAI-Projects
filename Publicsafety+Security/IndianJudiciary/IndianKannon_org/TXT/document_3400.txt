                Dated this the 24th July, 2008

                       J U D G M E N T
Petitioner retired as an Assistant Engineer from the Kerala State Electricity Board on 31.05.2005. He has received the terminal benefits. According to him, he is also entitled to certain amount which he is entitled to by way of Overtime allowance during the period from July 1995 to September,1996 has not been disbursed. Apparently, petitioner's request was being processed, as evidenced by Exhibit P1, contends the learned counsel for the petitioner.
2. Exhibit P2 representation has been submitted before the Secretary of the Board in which according to the petitioner an amount of Rs.62,821/- is due by way of Overtime allowance.
3. Learned standing counsel for the Electricity Board submits that the claim made by the petitioner is highly belated. It relates to the period from July 1995 to W.P ( C) No. 22313 of 2008 September, 1996. It will be difficult to verify the correctness of the claim made by the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the claim has already been verified and this is evidenced by Exhibit P1.
Having heard the counsel on both sides, the writ petition is disposed of directing the 1st respondent to consider Exhibit P2 and pass orders thereon, within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
