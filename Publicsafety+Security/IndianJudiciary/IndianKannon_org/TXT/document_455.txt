Therefore, this Court has suggested to Clerk Mr. H.H. Khristi that if, Party-in-person is present today, then call him in Chamber. Accordingly, Party-in-person is personally present in Chamber.
This Court has suggested accordingly to Party-in-person that he can file either a separate application to join such persons or to withdraw present civil application with a liberty to file fresh application then this Court can pass appropriate order.
Accordingly, Party-in-person made a statement before this Court that at this stage, permission may be granted to him to withdraw present application with a liberty to file fresh civil application by joining these other persons on same cause of action.
Considering his request, permission is granted to applicant Party-in-person Mr. Parmar to withdraw present application with a view to file fresh application on same cause of action after joining other persons whose names are mentioned in affidavit which has been presented by him today before registry of this Court in present application.
Accordingly, present application is disposed of as withdrawn.
