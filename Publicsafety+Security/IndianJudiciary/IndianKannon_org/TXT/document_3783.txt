Background
1. The  Applicant  filed  an  RTI  application dt.19.6.10 seeking information on the action taken on his  complaint  dt.27.11.96.   Shri  Raj Singh, CPIO­5 replied on 21.7.10 enclosing the reply dt.20.7.10  furnished   by   Shri   A.K.Singh,   SO   who   stated   that   as   per   available   record,   no   such   complaint  dt.27.11.96 was received in Vigilance Directorate of Railway Board.   The Applicant filed an appeal  dt.25.7.10 with the Appellate Authority stating that no information has been received by him till date.  Shri A.K.Mitra, Appellate Authority replied on 6.9.10 enclosing the reply furnished by the concerned  officer who gave the reply as follows:
"In the reply to RTI application of Shri Satish M. Ghiya, it was informed that the records   pertaining to his complaint dt.27.11.1996 were not readily available.  After receipt of his   application all records were thoroughly searched and after a lot of efforts, ultimately it   was found that complaint of shri Satish M. Ghiya had been received in Railway Board's   Office and dealt on File No.1997/V2/CR/G/4 during the period of 14.1.1997 to 1.9.1997.   In accordance with extant instructions regarding maintenance of records, the case file   had been destroyed".
Being aggrieved with the reply, the Applicant filed a second appeal dt.1.10.10 before CIC. Decision
2. During the hearing, the Respondents submitted that the case pertains to misuse of LTC and that an  investigation was conducted  by the Vigilance officials of the Central Railway and since this involved  a Group A officer, the matter came to the Railway Board Vigilance Section  who disposed of the case  with the remarks 'Case Closed.   No action taken'.  He added that the file  however, was destroyed by  the vigilance section on 5.7.05.  When queried whether the copy of the complaint and investigation  report  are  available with the Central Railway, the Respondents were unable to give a proper reply.
3. The Commission after hearing the submissions of both sides   directs the PIO to transfer the RTI  application to the PIO, Central Railway, Nagpur  along with this order of the Commission directing the  PIO to   provide the Appellant the information requested by him,   by 24.2.11 and the Appellant to  submit a compliance report to the Commission  by 5.3.11.  In the event of non­availability of records,  the   PIO,  Central  Railway,  Nagpur  to  provide  an  affidavit  to  the  Commission  with  a  copy  to  the  Appellant affirming the non availability of information and also giving  reasons for its non­availability.  The Affidavit should reach the Commission/Appellant by 5.3.11.
