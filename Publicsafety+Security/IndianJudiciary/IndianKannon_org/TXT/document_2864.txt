                                          Decision:

1.     In response to the RTI application for information relating to the promotion of staff, the
PIO has replied and furnished the information on the basis of available records. Being dis-
satisfied with the response, the appellant has submitted his complaint before the Commission.


2.     The information asked for is not specified as per section 2 (f) of the Act, which requires
that the requested information should be available in any material form. The appellant is
accordingly advised to seek inspection of records so as to specify the required information,
which should be furnished to him as per the provisions of the Act.


3.     Since there is no denial of information and that there are no provision in the Act for
redressal of grievances of the respondent's employees, this complaint is considered
unnecessary and is thus disposed of.
