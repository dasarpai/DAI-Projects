                         *****

RANJIT SINGH, J.
Prayer is for grant of arrears of technical pay, which has been allowed since 1990. Some similarly situated persons have been allowed these arrears. For the same cause, the petitioners have served a legal notice on which no action is being taken.
Without going into the merits of the controversy, the present writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to decide the legal notice served by the petitioners within a reasonable time.
