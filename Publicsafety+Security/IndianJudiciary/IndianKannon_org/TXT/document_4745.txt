S.D.ANAND, J. (ORAL)
Learned State Counsel informs that he is not in a position to contest the averment that certain land owners, whose land had been acquired vide the impugned notification itself had been awarded compensation at the rate of Rs.35,000/- by the learned Reference Court.
Learned counsel for the appellants states that he would be content and interests of justice would be served if the compensation already awarded to the appellants in this matter is enhanced to be payable at the rate of Rs.35,000/- per acre. This is insofar as the land acquired is concerned.
Insofar as the assessment of value of the tree plantation is concerned, it is common ground presently that matter is covered by the judgment dated 19.11.1997 passed in LPA No.1169 of 1987 titled as `Urmila Kakkar Vs. State of Haryana'.
The appeal shall stand disposed of accordingly in the light of the consensual position aforementioned. The appellants shall be entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.35,000/- per acre in respect of the acquired land. Qua the valuation of the plantations, the appellants would be entitled to amount of compensation in accordance with the judgment dated 19.11.2007 passed in Urmila Kakkar's case (supra).
