                                          O R D E R
The learned counsel for the petitioners prays, the learned Public Prosecutor does not oppose the said prayer and I am satisfied that the condition imposed on the petitioners, who face allegations, inter alia, under Section 307 I.P.C. when they were released on bail as per order dt.24.4.2007 that they must report before the Investigating Officer on all Fridays at 10 a.m., can now be modified. I am satisfied that there is merit in the contention of the learned Prosecutor that it is too early to delete the conditions altogether.
2. This Crl.M.C. is hence allowed in part. The petitioners need hereafter appear before the Investigating Officer on the first Friday of all English Calender months until the final report is filed.
