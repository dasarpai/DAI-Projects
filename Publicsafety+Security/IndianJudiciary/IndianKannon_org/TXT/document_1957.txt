Need For Commissioning New Broad Gauge Rail Line Between Kapadwanj ... on 19 December, 2001
Title:Need for commissioning new broad gauge rail line between Kapadwanj and Modasa in Western region for traffic - Laid.
SHRI MADHUSUDAN MISTRY (SABARKANTA) : The Railway Ministry has laid a new broad gauge line between Kapadwanj and Modasa in Western region of Gujarat. Though the work has been completed since long and even the trial run has been done, the new railway line is still to be opened for movement of passengers and goods. The hinterland for this railway line can provide enough business. The traders, the farmers the small industries would be benefited. I request the Union Government to take note of this and open the railway line early.
