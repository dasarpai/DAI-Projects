                   Nos.20731(N), 23017 (B), 24094 (J)
                       & 24152 (T) of 2010
            ---------------------------------
          Dated, this the 17th day of September, 2010

                          J U D G M E N T
These writ petitions are filed by students, who have completed B.Tech degree course from the Cochin University of Science and Technology. The students failed in some of the papers in the University Examinations, and they appeared in the supplementary examinations, which according to the University were over by the last week of June, 2010. They apprehend that on account of the delay in the publication of the results, some of them, who have already secured admission for higher studies inside and outside the country and who have already got employment, are likely to lose all these opportunities. It is in this background, they filed these writ petitions seeking a direction to the University to expedite the valuation and declare the results.
2. The stand taken by the respondent University is that the valuation camp has already started, that altogether there are above 7000 answer papers to be valued, and that the valuation will be completed and results declared by the end of November, 2010. On WP(C) Nos.20731, 23017, 24094 & 24152 of 2010 previous occasions, when considering the urgency pointed out by the petitioners that the delay will seriously affect their future, this Court passed various orders requiring the respondent University to expedite the valuation and report the progress before this Court. However, so far there has not been any appreciable progress in the matter.
3. From the submissions made by both sides, it is evident that these students are covered by Old Scheme. It is also seen that out of the total of 7677 students, who have appeared for the examination in the subject 'Engineering Graphics', there are only 124 students, who are covered by the Old Scheme. Similar is the case of the subject 'Engineering Chemistry' as well, where out of 7034 students who have appeared for the examination in the subject, there are only 352 students who are covered by the Old Scheme. Necessarily, therefore, the answer papers of the students covered by the Old Scheme will have to be segregated and valued separately. If that be so, if the respondent University takes certain amount of effort, it should be possible for the University to segregate these answer papers and value the same, so that the results could be declared at an early date.
WP(C) Nos.20731, 23017, 24094 & 24152 of 2010
4. Considering the peculiarity of the situation and the future of the students involved, I am inclined to direct the respondent University to segregate the answer papers of the supplementary examinations of the students, who are covered under the Old Scheme, value the same and declare the results as expeditiously as possible, not later than 15/10/2010. If for any reason, it is not possible for the respondent University to declare the results by that time, the University shall get the marks ready by that time, so that the students can apply to the University for communicating their marks confidentially to the Institutions, where the students have secured admission or employment.
In so far as WP(C) No. 23017/2010 is concerned, the petitioner therein also seeks a direction for publication of the 4th semester examination results. It is submitted by both sides that this Court has already passed such a direction in the judgment in WP(C) No. 19896/2010 to publish the results before 15/10/2010. Therefore, there will be a direction to that effect, in this writ petition also.
These writ petitions are disposed of as above.
