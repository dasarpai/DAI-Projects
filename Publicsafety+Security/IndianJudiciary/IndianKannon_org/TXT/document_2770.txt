L. N. MITTAL, J. (Oral) :
Jitender and Tejpal have filed the instant petition for grant of anticipatory bail in case FIR No.64 dated 06.05.2007, under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and also under Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, registered at Police Station Kosli, District Rewari.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case file.
The petitioners were found innocent by the police after investigation, but have now been summoned as additional accused by the trial court on prosecution application filed under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is also contended that impersonator was identified by Manoj Kumar, Jaswant and Billu and in fact, the petitioners are victims of the fraud played by them.
Without going into the merits of the case, the instant petition is allowed. The petitioners shall appear in the trial court within fifteen days from today and on their appearance, they shall be released on bail to the satisfaction of the trial court.
August 10, 2009                                     ( L. N. MITTAL )
