Mahipal Singh And Ors. vs D.D.A. on 6 March, 2007
Author: R Sharma
Bench: R Sharma
JUDGMENT Rekha Sharma, J.
1. This writ petition has been filed by the Assistant Sanitary Inspectors working in Delhi Development Authority seeking parity of pay scale with their counter parts working in MCD and NDMC. It is submitted by learned Counsel for the petitioners that the Assistant Sanitary Inspectors employed by DDA are performing and discharging similar functions and duties as are being discharged by the Assistant Sanitary Inspectors employed by the MCD and NDMC. This fact is disputed by learned Counsel for the DDA. In any case, it is submitted by learned Counsel for the respondent - DDA that, according to the own case of the petitioners as stated in para 8 of page 6 of the writ petition the matter is pending with the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India and a final word has to come from there. The petitioner has not sought any relief against the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Insofar as Delhi Development Authority is concerned, it has already forwarded the matter to the concerned Ministry.
2. In this view of the matter, the writ petition is pre-mature and is dismissed as such.
