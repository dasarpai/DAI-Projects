Hon'ble Ashok Kumar Roopanwal,J.
Heard Mr. Anil Kumar Shukla, learned counsel for the applicants and learned AGA for the State.
In this case after investigation and due collection of evidence charge sheet has been submitted by the police. Mr. Shukla has not been able to point out that no evidence was collected so as to constitute the offences punishable under Sections 498-A, 323, IPC.
In such view of the matter, the charge sheet being based on the proper collection of evidence requires no quashing.
Accordingly, this petition has no merits and is dismissed.
However, it is expected that the court concerned shall decide the bail application of the applicants as per the law laid down in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh Vs. State of U.P. and others, 2009(2) Crimes 4 SC. Order Date :- 7.7.2010 T. Sinha
