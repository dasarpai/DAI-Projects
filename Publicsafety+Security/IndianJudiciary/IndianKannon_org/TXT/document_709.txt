                 W.P.(C) No.24918 of 2010
              -------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 10th August, 2010

                           JUDGMENT
The petitioner is a stage carriage operator conducting services on the route Nedumkandom-Kottayam on the strength of a regular permit issued in respect of his stage carriage bearing Reg.No.KL-33/A 8840. The permit is valid till 9.4.2012. Since the length of the petitioner's route is 158 kms., the petitioner has submitted an application for the conversion of his service from a Limited Stop Ordinary Service (LSOS) to a Fast Passenger. The petitioner complains that his request has not been considered till date. Therefore, he seeks the issue of appropriate directions to expedite the consideration of his application. The learned Senior Government Pleader has no objection to such a direction being issued.
2. It can be seen that the variation that is sought for by the petitioner is in compliance with the provisions of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules. There is no reason why the consideration of the application of the petitioner should be delayed. It is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that a meeting of the Regional Transport Authority is scheduled to be conducted on 16.8.2010.
3. In the above circumstances, this writ petition is disposed of directing the respondent to consider the application submitted by the petitioner, evidenced herein by Ext.P1, in the light of Ext.P2 and to pass final orders thereon in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible and at any rate within a period of one month or by placing the same before the meeting that is scheduled to be held on 16.8.2010, whichever is earlier.
