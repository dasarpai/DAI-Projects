Equivalent citations: (2000) 2 UPLBEC 1364
Author: R Agrawal
Bench: R Agrawal
JUDGMENT R.K. Agrawal, J.
1. Sri Neeraj Tripathi, Advocate has put in appearance on behalf of respondent No. 2 whereas Sri R.C. Singh, Advocate has put in appearance on behalf of respondent No. 6.
2. The only ground raised by the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that the U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission, respondent No. 2, while making selection for the post of Principal in Sri Shyam Lal Angney Lal Balika Inter College, Shahjahanpur, had recommended the name of only two persons and not three as required under Sub-section (6) of Section 16-E of U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921, Sub-section (6) of Section 16-E of the Act provides that the selection committee shall prepare a list containing in order of preference the names, as far as practicable, three candidates for each post found by it to be suitable for appointment and shall communicate its recommendations together with such list to the Committee of Management. It is not obligatory upon the Commission or the Selection Board to send three names in all the cases for each post. If for any reason the Selection Board finds only two persons to be qualified, it can recommend only two names and not three. There is no forge in the argument of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.
3. The writ petition has no force and it is dismissed in limine.
