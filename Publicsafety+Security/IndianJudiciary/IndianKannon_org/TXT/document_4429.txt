                                 ...
F.No. CIC/AT/A/2009/000101 Dated, the 25th June, 2009 Appellant : Smt. T.A. Gaikwad Respondents : Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) This matter was heard on 19.05.2009 pursuant to Commission's notice dated 17.04.2009. Appellant was absent, when called. Respondents were present through CPIO.
2. CPIO submitted during the hearing that all information, other than item No. 1 of appellant's RTI-application dated 06.12.2007, had been provided him through a reply dated 07.01.2008. As regards item No. 1, CPIO submitted that appellant wanted 20 years' (1987 to 2008) information in a format given by him.
3. After hearing the CPIO and upon perusing the records, it is found unfeasible to allow the appellant to receive such voluminous information in a format given by him. Nevertheless, in order to satisfy the appellant, it is proposed to allow the appellant to inspect all records--subject to availability--connected with item No. 1 of his RTI-application dated 06.12.2007. It is, therefore, directed that the CPIO, on a day, time and place to be identified for the purpose and intimated to the appellant, shall allow the appellant to inspect all available records connected with item No. 1 of his RTI-application dated 06.12.2007. He, on payment of fee, shall also allow the appellant to take copies or certified copies from the inspected records. This exercise should be completed within 4 weeks of the receipt of this decision.
4. Appeal disposed of with the above direction.
5. Copy of this decision be sent to the parties.
