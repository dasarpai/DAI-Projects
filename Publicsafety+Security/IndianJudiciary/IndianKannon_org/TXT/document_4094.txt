                 Crl.M.C.No.1846 of 2010
                --------------------------------------
            Dated this the 10th day of June, 2010

                              ORDER
Petitioner, who is the 6th accused in C.C. No.1528 of 2009 (Crime No.465/2009 of Pavaratti Police Station) on the file of the J.F.C.M., Chavakkad for offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 498A, 323, 294(b) of I.P.C. read with Section 34 of I.P.C. seeks to quash Annexure-I charge sheet and all further proceedings. This is an offshoot of a matrimonial dispute.
2. In the light of the subsequent settlement of the dispute between the marital parties, the petitioner has approached this Court by invoking the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Having regard to the resolution of the disputes between the marital parties, continuance of the criminal prosecution against the petitioner is an avoidable irritant.
3. Eventhough the offences under Sections 406, 498A, 294(b) of I.P.C. read with Section 34 of I.P.C. are not compoundable, in the light of the decision of the Apex Crl.M.C.No.1846/2010 Court in B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana (AIR 2003 SC 1386), the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. can be invoked by this Court to bring about premature termination of the prosecution.
Accordingly, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is allowed. C.C.No.1528/2009 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad shall stand quashed.
V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE skj
