(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
2. 18-10-2011 Interlocutory Application No. 7230 of 2011:
Delay of 87 days occurred in filing the Letters Patent Appeal is condoned.
Interlocutory Application stands disposed of. Letters Patent Appeal No.1527 of 2011:
Feeling aggrieved by judgment and order dated 13th May 2011 made by the learned single Judge in above C.W.J.C. No. 8422 of 2011, the writ petitioner has preferred the present Appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent.
The subject matter of dispute is non-selection of the appellant for appointment as Panchayat Shikshak in Gram Panchayat Asta under Tharthari Block, District Nalanda and selection and appointment of respondent no.8. The appellate authority below and the learned single Judge have recorded concurrent finding that the appellant, at the time of counselling, did not produce the relevant documents for verification. Rejection of his candidature was, therefore, justified.
In view of the aforesaid concurrent finding, no interference is warranted. Appeal is dismissed in limine.
