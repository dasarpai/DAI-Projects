Chief Information Commissioner : Shri Satyananda Mishra
2. In our order dated 28 June 2011, we had directed the then CPIO not  only to provide the information but also to appear before us today to explain the  reasons for having denied the information so very casually. Today, during the  hearing,   the   then   CPIO   Sri   JK   Agrawal   did   not   turn   up;   in   his   place,   the  Manager, Law appeared. He submitted that the desired information had since  been provided to the Appellant as per the direction of the CIC. Although he had  certain submissions to make in regard to the response of the then CPIO in this  matter, in our opinion, it would be appropriate to hear the explanation of the  CIC/SM/A/2010/001131 officer concerned before we can decide on the question of penalty. Therefore,  we again direct the present CPIO to forward a copy of this order to the officer  who was the CPIO at the relevant time with the further direction that that officer  should appear before the Commission  (Room No. 306, 2nd  Floor, B Wing,   August Kranti Bhawan, Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi - 110 066) on 28   September   2011   at   10.45   a.m.  either  in   person  or   through  his  authorised  representative   to   explain   if   he   had   any   reasonable   cause   for   denying   the  information in such a casual manner. It may be noted that this would be the last  opportunity for him to present his case. If he fails to appear either in person or  through   his   authorised   representative   on   the   next   date   or   to   offer   any  satisfactory explanation, we will proceed to decide on the penalty in terms of  Section 20(1) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
3. Copies of this order be given free of cost to the parties.
(Satyananda Mishra) Chief Information Commissioner Authenticated true copy.  Additional copies of orders shall be supplied against  application and payment of the charges prescribed under the Act to the CPIO of this  Commission.
