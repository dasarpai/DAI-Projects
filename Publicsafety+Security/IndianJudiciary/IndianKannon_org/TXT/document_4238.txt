Heard learned counsel for the applicants and learned A.G.A. This application has been filed by the applicants Nirmal Chand Mitttal  and another against the order dated 16.12.2009 passed by A.C.J.M.  Court No. 1, Aligarh in case No. Nil of 2009 whereby the application  under section 156(3) has been allowed and the Officer Incharge of  the police station concerned has been directed to register the case  and   investigate   the   same   in   exercise   of   powers   conferred   under  section 156(3) Cr.P.C. 
It   is  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for   the  applicants   that  the  impugned order is illegal, it has not been passed in accordance with  the provisions of law.
It has been rebutted by the learned A.G.A. by submitting that there is  no   illegality   in   the   impugned   order   because   on   the   basis   of   the  allegations made in the application under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. a  prima facie cognizable offence is made out and the allegations are of  such nature which requires investigation. There is no illegality in the  impugned order.
Considering the submissions made by the learned counsel for the  applicants   and   the   learned   A.G.A.   and   from   the   perusal   of   the  application under section 156(3) Cr.P.C., it appears that on the basis  of the allegation made therein a prima facie cognizable offence is  made out and the allegations are of such a nature which requires  investigation, the impugned order is not suffering from any illegality or  irregularity, therefore, the prayer for quashing the impugned order is  refused.
It is further contended that the applicants are men of peace loving.  They shall cooperate with the investigation. In case, the applicants  are arrested and sent to jail during investigation, the applicants shall  suffer irreparable loss. Therefore, the applicants may not be arrested  during investigation.
Considering   the   facts,   circumstances   of   the   case   and   the  submissions made by the learned counsel for the applicants and the  learned   A.G.A,   it   is   directed   that  in   case  the   FIR   has   not   been  registered till today, if it is lodged subsequently, in pursuance to  the   impugned   order,   the   applicants   shall   not   be   arrested   during  investigation of the case but the applicants shall cooperate with the  investigation.
With this direction this application is finally disposed of. Order Date :- 21.1.2010 RPD
