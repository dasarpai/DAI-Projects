ORAL ORDER
Considering the request and submissions of the concerned parties, S.O. to 9th July, 2008.
Mr.
Tolia submits that the further proceedings before the learned trial Court is scheduled to take place on 5.7.2008 i.e. tomorrow. He further submits that in view of the fact that the proceedings of this application is adjourned to 9th July, 2008, his client would make the application for adjournment before the learned trial Court. He, however, apprehends that since earlier the application was rejected, this application, which may be tendered on 5th July, 2008 may not be granted. It would be open to the client of Mr. Tolia to submit an application for adjournment. The learned trial Court may consider the said application. While considering the application, the learned trial Court may also consider that the proceedings of this matter are adjourned to 9th July, 2008.
