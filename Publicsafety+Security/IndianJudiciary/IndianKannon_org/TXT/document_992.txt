    ------------------------------------------------
     Dated this the 9th day of October, 2009

                     JUDGMENT
Pius C. Kuriakose, J This appeal by the Government pertains to acquisition of land for NTPC for their Kayamkulam Project. Having gone through the impugned judgment, we are of the view that the enhancement granted is below 150% over what was awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer. In fact, the Requisitioning Authority itself took a decision not to go for appeals in case enhancement is up to 150%. The appeal is dismissed.
