                       -------------------------------------
                Dated this the 16th day of July, 2008

                                    ORDER
Petitioners complain about inadequate investigation in Crime No.101 of 1990 of Rajakkad Police Station. That crime relates to the unnatural death of one Sathi, mother of the 2nd petitioner. The 1st petitioner claims to be a social worker who has taken active interest to ensure such proper investigation of this case. The crux of the allegations is that the said deceased Sathi expired on 17.09.1990 while she was undergoing treatment at the Janatha hospital at Rajakkad. Investigation has been dragging on for the past about 18 years. But the final report has not been filed yet.
2. Statements have been filed by the respondents. The learned Government Pleader now submits that the investigation is almost complete and given reasonable further time, the investigators shall now file final report in the matter. A copy of the final report shall be furnished to the 2nd petitioner herein whereupon the 2nd petitioner, if she is aggrieved by such final report, shall have all the avenues of challenge open to her.
3. I am satisfied, in these circumstances, that this Writ Petition can be dismissed with appropriate observations accepting the submissions of the learned Government Pleader.
4. This Writ Petition is, in these circumstances, dismissed with the direction that the Investigating Officer shall complete the investigation within a period of 45 days from this date and shall file final report in Crime No.101 of 1990 of Rajakkad Police Station. A copy of such final report shall be furnished to the 2nd petitioner and it shall be open to the 2nd petitioner, if the 2nd petitioner feels aggrieved by the final report, to challenge the said final report in accordance with law before appropriate authorities.
