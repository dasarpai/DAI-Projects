 Proceedings
The Commissioner asked whether the information was provided to the Appellant.
The appellant pointed out that whereas information had been given to him about the
status of this complaint after the RTI application, the respondents had not given the
information about the action taken on his complaints from the date that the filed the complaints, up to the date the RTI application. The respondents said that they had understood that they needed to provide this information only after the date of the filing of the RTI application. They have been directed to furnish this information to the appellant by 6, November 2008 for the action taken on the complaints from the date that the complaints of filed.
On the question of imposing penalties on the responsible officers they claim that the RTI application had initially been handled by one person and from there it went to 3 different departments and the various officers have handled the application, and therefore it was difficult for them to identify the responsible officers. The commission has asked them to prepare a table listing the movement of the RTI application and the names and designations of the officers who had handled the RTI application. They were directed to deliver this by 06/11/2008 after which the commission will decide on the further action to be taken.
