Rule.
Mr.U.A. Trivedi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, waives service of Rule on behalf of the respondent-State.
This application is filed by the applicant under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 for releasing him on regular bail in connection with the offences registered at CR No.I-360 of 2009 registered with Sector 7, Gandhinagar, for the offences punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 135 of the Bombay Police Act.
Heard Mr.Ashis Dagli, learned counsel for the applicant and Mr.U.A. Trivedi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, for the State.
Mr.Dagli has submitted that the applicant is innocent and has not committed any offence. He has also contended that it is not established on record that applicant is involved in the unlawful assembly. He has also contended that no recovery or discovery is made from the applicant. He read the order passed by the trial Court and prayed to release the applicant on regular bail.
As against this, Mr.Trivedi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, has strongly opposed the present application and read the order passed by the trial Court.
I have gone through the order passed by the trial Court as well as papers produced on record of the case. Looking to the allegations levelled against the applicant, I am inclined to release him on regular bail.
Learned counsels for the parties do not press for reasoned order.
Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the application is allowed and applicant is ordered to be released on bail in connection with CR No.I-360 of 2009 registered with Sector 7 Police Station, Gandhinagar for the offences alleged against him in this application on his executing bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand Only) with one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the lower Court and subject to the conditions that he shall, (I) not take undue advantage of his liberty or abuse his liberty;
(ii) not act in a manner injurious to the prosecution;

(iv) mark his presence before the Investigating Officer on every first day of the calender month between 09:00 a.m. to 02:00 p.m.;
(v) Surrender his passport, if any, to the lower Court within a week;
The Authority will release the applicant only if he is not required in connection with any other offence for the time being.
If breach of any of the above conditions is committed, the concerned Sessions Judge will be free to issue warrant or take appropriate action in the matter.
Bail bond to be executed before the lower Court having jurisdiction to try the case.
At the trial, the trial Court shall not be influenced by the observations of preliminary nature, qua the evidence at this stage, made by this Court while enlarging the applicant on bail. Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent.
Direct Service is permitted.
