          Dated this the 9th day of February, 2011

                           J U D G M E N T
Petitioner, a PWD Contractor, submits that he undertook the work of laying sewage Main Line reconstruction in the premises of SAT Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram for the fourth respondent. He submits that the work was executed in 2009 and that the bill amount comes to `17,99,000/-. It is stated that despite having executed the work to the satisfaction of the respondents, payment has not been disbursed. According to the petitioner, even Ext.P5 representation made to the fifth respondent did not evoke any response. It is in these circumstances the writ petition has been filed.
2. If as stated by the petitioner, the work has been executed, prima facie, there is no reason for non payment. Be that as it may, taking note of his case that Ext.P5 submitted to the fifth respondent is pending, I dispose of this W.P.(C) No.4193/2011 writ petition, directing the fifth respondent to consider and pass orders on Ext.P5. This shall be done as expeditiously as possible and at any rate, within four weeks from the date of production of a copy of this judgment along with a copy of the writ petition.
