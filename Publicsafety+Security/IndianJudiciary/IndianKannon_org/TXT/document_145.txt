04. 13.9.2010 Having heard learned senior counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the order passed against the petitioner imposing certain punishment which stands substantially diluted by the appellate authority. It cannot be said that no charge was being made out against the petitioner for being imposed punishment in question.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the earlier imposition of punishment is coming in the way of petitioner's promotion.
This Court has reservation on such a submission because effect of such punishment can only occupy the field for the period of three years since none of the punishment can be said to be major punishment as would be evident from the order passed by the appellate authority.
The writ application is dismissed with observation as above.
