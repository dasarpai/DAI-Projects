Need For Conversion Of Fakiragram And Dhubri Metre-Gauge Railway ... on 3 December, 2002
>Title: Need for conversion of Fakiragram and Dhubri metre-gauge railway line in Assam into broad-gauge during current financial year.
SHRI ABDUL HAMID (DHUBRI): It is a long standing demand by the people of Dhubri District of Assam for conversion of railway line from Fakiragram to Dhubri (70 KM) into broad-gauge line. It is also the national policy of the Indian Railways to convert all the meter-gauge lines into broad-gauge lines all over the country. But, unfortunately, this 70-KM long railway line from Fakiragram to Dhubri is not getting any importance by the N.F. Railway. The conversion work from New Alipur to New Bongaigaon is going on but via Fakiragram to Dhubri is abandoned. It is the oldest railway line of N.F. Railway. The entire railway track has become deplorable. The passenger train has been stopped since long back. The goods train for carrying the foodgrains has suffered. All the welfare schemes introduced by the Central Government are not properly implemented due to lack of railway services. So, I urge upon the Railway Ministry to take necessary steps to convert the railway line from Fakiragram to Dhubri into broad-gauge line during this current financial year.
