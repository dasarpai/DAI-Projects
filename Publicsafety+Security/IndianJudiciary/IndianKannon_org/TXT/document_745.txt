Learned AGA could not dispute the said fact.
Without expressing any opinion on the merit, let the appellant Ram Nath Singh be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 1 lac with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial judge concerned in the above Sessions Trial for above offence. As soon personal and surety bonds are furnished, photocopies of the same are directed to be transmitted to this court forthwith by trial judge concerned to be kept on the record of this appeal.
