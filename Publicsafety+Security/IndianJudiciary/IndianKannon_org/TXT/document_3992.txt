Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State.
Petitioner has been made accused in connection with Koderma P.S. Case No. 52 of 1993 for the offence under Sections 224 of the I.P.C.
The petitioner was on bail and since he jumped the bail, his bail bonds have been cancelled on 29.03.2006. Subsequently, he appeared before the court below on 24.03.2011 and he is in custody since then.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the laches on the part of the petitioner was due to the fact that during the trial the case has been transferred from one court to another.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner, Latey Ram is directed to be released on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten thousand) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Koderma in connection with Koderma P.S. Case No. 52 of 1993 corresponding to G.R. No. 109 of 1993.
