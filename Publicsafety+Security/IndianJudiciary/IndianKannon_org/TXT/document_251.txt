Accordingly we direct that the custody of the two minor children shall continue with the respondent/father. The petitioner/mother is entitled to temporary custody for a period of two days in alternate weeks and for a period of one week each during Onam and Christmas holidays (first one week) and also for one month during summer holidays.

The same timings are also applicable for Onam and Chirstmas holidays and summer holidays as well. The respondent/father shall hand over the children to the petitioner/mother at the same premises. in view of the arrangement regarding custody regarding the chilldren, O.P 288/2005 pending before the Family Court, Nadumangad is strucked off from its file.
