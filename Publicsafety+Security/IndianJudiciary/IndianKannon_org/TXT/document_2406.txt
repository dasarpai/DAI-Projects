ORAL
ORDER
BELOW SPEAKING TO MINUTES The captioned note (speaking to minutes) is taken out by the original petitioner. It is stated in the note that in third paragraph (on first page) of the order dated 13.10.2010 while mentioning the amount of maintenance awarded by the learned Trial Court instead of the figure of Rs.1,500/- (Rupees One Thousand Five Hundred) inadvertently figure of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Thousand) is mentioned. Therefore, request to correct the figure of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Thousand ) to Rs.1,500/- (Rupees One Thousand Five Hundred) is made in the aforesaid note.
On perusal of the order dated 10.5.2010 passed by the learned Trial Court below exhibit-11, it clear comes out that the learned Trial Court has awarded Rs.1,500/-(Rupees One Thousand Five Hundred)per month towards maintenance. Therefore request made in the note is granted. Paragraph No.3 (on first page) of the order dated 13.10.2010 is ordered to be corrected by substituting the figure of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Thousand) by figure of Rs.1,500/- (Rupees One Thousand Five Hundred).
It is also pointed out in the aforesaid note (speaking to minutes) that in the fifth line of the fourth paragraph (page two of the order) the year 2001 ought to have been mentioned as year 2011 but due to typographical error it is mentioned as 2001. The said error is directed to be corrected and the year 2001 in fifth line of the paragraph No.4 on page two of the order is directed to be corrected by mentioning year 2011.
The note (speaking to minutes) is disposed of.
