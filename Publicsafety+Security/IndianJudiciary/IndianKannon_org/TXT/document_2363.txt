                        JUDGMENT
Koshy, J.
This is an application to condone the long delay of 1297 days in filing the writ appeal. In the affidavit filed in support of the delay condonation application, the delay is not explained at all, except the fact that a review petition was filed subsequently, but the review petition was dismissed on 6.3.2007. Absolutely no grounds are stated for condonation of more than three years delay in filing the writ appeal. It is submitted that the judgment involves financial liability. But the judgment is confined to the facts of this case alone. Since there is no ground to condone the long delay of 1297 days, the delay condonation application is dismissed. Consequently, the appeal also stands dismissed.
