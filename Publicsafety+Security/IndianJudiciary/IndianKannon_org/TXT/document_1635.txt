               IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                        CR. APP (DB) No.205 of 2009
                              MOULA YADAV
                                   Versus
                            THE STATE OF BIHAR
                                  -----------
05/ 26.04.2011 Heard learned Counsel for the appellant and learned Counsel for the State.
The learned Counsel for the appellant has renewed prayer for bail of the appellant namely Moula Yadav through I.A. No. 867 of 2011.
Earlier, the case of the appellant was considered on 24.03.2009 but on that date there was no prayer for bail so, no order was passed but the Court has noticed that there was specific allegation against him that he fired on the neck of the deceased, after taking away money from his pocket. On the next occasion, when the appellant prayed for bail then the Court has considered his defence in detail on 21.01.2010 and his prayer for bail was rejected.
Considering the allegation that the appellant is sole person who has caused death of the husband of the deceased, we are not inclined to grant bail to the above named appellant.
Accordingly, his prayer for bail is rejected.
