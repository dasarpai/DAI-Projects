ORAL
JUDGMENT
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.L.DAVE) Heard learned advocates for the parties.
This is an application for condonation of delay of 228 days caused in preferring the Letters Patent Appeal by the applicant.
Upon going through the application, it cannot be said that the cause for delay is not explained. The appellant could have drawn no legitimate benefit by delaying the matter. Under the circumstances, we are inclined to accept this application. The application is allowed. Delay of 228 days caused in preferring Letters Patent Appeal is condoned. Rule made absolute.
