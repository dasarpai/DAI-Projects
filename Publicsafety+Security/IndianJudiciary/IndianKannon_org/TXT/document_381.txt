ORDER--Granting the investment allowance.
Ratio:
On granting the investment allowance, the order could not be said prejudicial since there would be no tax effect if allowance was not allowed.
Held:
For the assessment year 1979-80, the Income Tax Officer's order could not be treated as erroneous since the assessee's income would come to nil even though investment allowance was not allowed and assessee was not treated as industrial company.
