Hon'ble Vikram Nath,J.
Pursuant to the order dated 17.5.2010 the opposite party no.2 is present. Sri Praveen Kumar Srivastava, Advocate has filed a counter affidavit on his behalf alongwith an application to discharge the contempt notice. From perusal of the counter affidavit it is apparent that despite the injunction order, the opposite parties have been attempting to raise constructions which resulted into quarrel between the applicant and the opposite parties compelling the opposite parties no. 2 & 3 to take appropriate preventive measures by taking action under Section 107/116 Cr.P.C. Further according to the affidavit filed by the opposite party no.2 it is apparent that continuous complaints were being received in the police station, for maintenance of peace and tranquility between the parties. Although it had been denied that the opposite parties no.2 &3 or the police of the police station concerned have helped the opposite party no.1 in raising the constructions but the fact remains that the constructions have been raised by the opposite party no.1 even after the injunction order.
List this case on 2.8.2010. In the meantime the applicant may file reply to the affidavits filed today. On the next date the opposite party no.1 shall remain present before this Court. Personal appearance of the opposite parties no. 2 & 3 at this stage is exempted. However they will remain present as and when ordered otherwise.
Order Date :- 13.7.2010 RPS
