It is submitted that as per the order passed by this Court, demarcation was done and the same is to be treated and considered as final.
3. Mr.Adil Mirza, learned advocate appearing on behalf of Opponent No.2 - Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority has stated that there is no new demarcation at all. However, in place of old one, fresh demarcation is made on very demarcation. When a pointed question was asked as to what is distance between earlier demarcation and fresh demarcation, he replied that the difference is hardly not more than 8 inches.
4. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, whatever fresh construction of compound wall is made, the same is to be treated to have been done in compliance of the order passed by this Court earlier. However, the same would be applicable only to those persons, who have already constructed the new compound wall and not with respect to those persons, who have yet not demolished their old compound wall and who have not put up new compound wall.
With this, the present petition is disposed of. No costs.
