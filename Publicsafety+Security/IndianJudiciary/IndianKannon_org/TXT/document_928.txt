The only prayer sought is for a direction to dispose of Ext.P4 appeal filed by the petitioner before the 1st respondent.
2. The learned Government Pleader has also, on instructions, confirmed the pendency of Ext.P4.
In view of the above, this writ petition is disposed of directing the 1st respondent to consider and pass orders on Ext.P4. This shall be done as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within three months of production of a copy of this judgment along with a copy of this writ petition.
This writ petition is disposed of as above.
(ANTONY DOMINIC, JUDGE) jg
