                   Bail Application No.385 of 2011
                -------------------------------
             Dated this the 14th day of January, 2011.

                               O R D E R
Petitioner who is the 2nd accused in C.C.No. 419 of 2009 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate -I, Sulthan Bathery, seeks anticipatory bail.
2. Admittedly, non-bailable warrants of arrest are pending against the petitioner. Anticipatory bail cannot be granted to nullify the process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. There is no reason why the petitioner should not surrender before the Magistrate and seek regular bail. Accordingly, if the petitioner surrenders before the Magistrate and files an application for regular bail within two weeks from today, the same shall be considered and disposed of preferably on the same day on which it is filed notwithstanding the pendency of non-bailable warrants of arrest against the petitioner and also after considering the explanation offered by the petitioner for his previous non-appearance.
With the above observation this application is disposed of .
V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE.
