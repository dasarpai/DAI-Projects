                   JUDGMENT
Learned Government Pleader appears for respondents 1 and 2. Notice to respondents 3 to 5 is dispensed with preserving their right to move for review of this judgment, if aggrieved. The petitioner availed a loan from respondents 3 and 4. It appears that the transaction is primarily funded by the fifth respondent. The first respondent issued Ext.P7 directing the third respondent to give the petitioner certain deductions in the total outstandings, having regard to the factors stated in Ext.P7 relatable to the rate of interest that could be charged on the basis of circulars. The complaint of the petitioner is that Ext.P7 is not being honoured and that Ext.P9 has been issued by the third respondent seeking repayment of amount which is far more than what is covered by Ext.P7. That is not a matter on which this Court should interfere since if the first respondent has issued Ext.P7, it will be within his authority to see that its enforcement is also done. To enable the petitioner to move the first respondent and seek further relief against Ext.P9, it is ordered that enforcement of Ext.P9 will stand suspended for three weeks. The writ petition is ordered accordingly.
