ORAL
ORDER
Heard Shri Samir Dave, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants and Ms Pathak, learned AGP appearing on behalf of opponent no. 6. So far as other opponents are concerned, they are not required to be heard.
The present application has been preferred by the applicants-original claimants permitting them to prosecute the First Appeal as indigent person. Considering the fact that the applicants were permitted to prosecute the Claim Petition before the learned tribunal as indigent person and the Claim Petition has been dismissed, and, therefore, the same position continues, the present application is allowed and the prayer in terms of paragraph 4(b) is granted. Rule is made absolute accordingly. No cost.
