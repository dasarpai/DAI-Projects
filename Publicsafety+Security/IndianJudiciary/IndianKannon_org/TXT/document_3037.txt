                                      O R D E R
Petitioner who is the second accused in C.R.No.59/2006 of Pathanamthitta Excise Range for offences punishable under Section 8(1) and (2) of the Kerala Abkari Act for allegedly having been found in possession of 7 litres of illicit arrack on 18.4.2007, seeks his enlargement on bail.
2. The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application submitting inter alia that the petitioner was arrested on 18.4.2007 in connection with another crime,viz.C.R.21/2007 of the very same Excise Range. I am not satisfied that the grounds enumerated under Clause (b)(ii) of Sec. 41 A of the Abkari Act are present in this case so as to justify the release of the petitioner on bail.
This Application is accordingly dismissed.
