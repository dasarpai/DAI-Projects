The writ petition has filed challenging the order of transfer of the petitioner from Thrikkunnappuzha to the Regional office of the Board in Chirayinkeezhu.
2. The petitioner is working as Lower Division Clerk under the respondent Board. The order of transfer is challenged on various grounds. The respondents have filed a counter affidavit and an additional counter affidavit justifying the order of transfer. Today when the matter came for further hearing the learned standing counsel for the respondents submitted that petitioner could be considered for a posting in Vaikom in the light of the difficulties and hardships pointed out by him consequent on his present transfer.
Therefore, Ext.P1 order is set aside. The respondents will pass appropriate orders as offered above in the matter expeditiously.
