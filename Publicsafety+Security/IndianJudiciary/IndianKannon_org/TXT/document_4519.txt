                 VILLAGE MISHRAULI, P.S. SIMARI, DISTRICT DARBHANGA

                                                Versus
                 1. THE STATE OF BIHAR                    ...... OPPOSITE PARTY.
                 2. SHESH NARAYAN MISHRA SON OF LATE LAXMI KANT
                    MISHRA, RESIDENT OF VILLAGE MISHRAULI, P.S. SIMARI,
                    DISTRICT DARBHANGA                    ..... OPPOSITE 2ND PARTY.
                                              -----------
2. 7.9.2010 The petitioner has sought quashing of the order dated 8.7.2008 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, F.T.C.V, Darbhanga in Criminal Revision No.426 of 2003, by which he has confirmed the order of the Executive Magistrate, Sadar Darbhanga passed on 22.9.2003 in T.R. No.41 of 2002/ M.R.No.1517 of 1992 by which he has declared the right of easement to first party, opposite 2nd party herein.
In my view, since the order impugned is completely valid and well reasoned, I see no reason to interfere in the matter.
The application is dismissed.
