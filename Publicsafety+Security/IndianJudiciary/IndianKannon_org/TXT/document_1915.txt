Patna High Court - Orders
Ram Pravesh Singh vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 July, 2011
                  IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                                 CWJC No.1988 of 2009
                                  Ram Pravesh Singh .
                                            Versus
                               The State Of Bihar & Ors .
                                         -----------
3. 04.07.2011 None for the petitioner.
Counsel for the State has assisted the Court from the pleadings in the writ application and also in the counter affidavit.
It appears that in response to an advertisement published in the year 2007 inviting applications to be considered for appointment on the post of Chaukidar in different villages, the petitioner has also responded. He is aggrieved by the denial of appointment to him.
The counter affidavit contends that he was duly considered but since he failed to secure the qualifying marks his name could not be included in the list of selected candidates.
In that view of the matter, the Court finds it difficult to grant any relief to the petitioner.
The application is dismissed.
