              CORAM : MR.JUSTICE P.B.MAJMUDAR


              Date of Order: 11/01/2002


ORAL ORDER
The mother of the petitioner was a Government Servant. She died while in service. Thereafter, father of the petitioner applied for compassionate appointment. The mother of the petitioner died as back as on 13th April, 1991. Immediately after the death, the father of the petitioner applied for compassionate appointment by application dated 25th June, 1991. This Application was rejected on 9.7.1992, as per the order at Annexure `C'. The father of the petitioner thereafter did not pursue the aforesaid matter further and after a considerable period, the petitioner, who is the son of the deceased employee, again gave an application that he may be given compassionate appointment and that since at the relevant time, he was a minor, after attaining majority, such application was made. It is required to be noted that the claim of the father of the petitioner was rejected as back as in the year 1992. Therefore, the question about compassionate appointment to the family members of the deceased was already concluded at that time. Thereafter, after a period of eight years, it was not open for the petitioner to give such application. The said request, therefore, made on behalf of the petitioner was rightly rejected by the Director by his decision dated 7th June, 2000. Once the request made on behalf of the father of the petitioner is rejected, no such application, at the instance of the present petitioner, was maintainable and was accordingly rightly rejected. I do not, therefore, find any substance in this petition. The petition is, therefore, dismissed at the admission stage.
