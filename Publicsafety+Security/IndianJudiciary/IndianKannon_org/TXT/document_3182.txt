"This petition has been filed under Section 439 Cr.P.C. seeking bail to the petitioner in case FIR No. 124 dated 20.06.2008 under Sections 302, 34 IPC, P.S. Sadar Gohana.
Learned counsel contends that the role ascribed to the petitioner is that he caught hold of Atam Parkash, the deceased and no injury has been ascribed to the petitioner".
Counsel for the State, on instructions from Dharam Singh, Assistant Sub Inspector, has stated that petitioner has caused no injury in the occurrence. Petitioner is in custody since 21.6.2008. Counsel for the State further submits that no witness has been recorded till today. 21 witnesses have been cited by the prosecution.
Trial of the case will take long time to conclude. Further detention of the petitioner is not warranted.
Hence, the present petition is accepted and the petitioner is ordered to be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sonepat.
