ORAL
ORDER
: Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.R.VORA) 1 Heard learned Senior Counsel Mr. A.D. Shah for the applicant and learned APP Mr. K.C. Shah on behalf the respondent ? State.
2 Criminal Appeal No. 1010 of 1985 came to be filed by Jatashankar Asharam Pande, one of the accused of Sessions Case No. 115 of 1984, against his conviction and sentence for the offence punishable under Section 304 Part-I of the Indian Penal Code by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.3, Ahmedabad, on 17th of October, 1985.
3 During pendency of the said Appeal No. 1010 of 1985, appellant Jatashankar Asharam Pande died and, hence, this Application came to be filed by the applicant Dharmendra Jatashankar Pande, being legal representative of the appellant, under Section 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for continuation of the said Appeal preferred by deceased Jatashankar Asharam Pande.
4 Learned Counsel for the applicant places on record an affidavit sworn by the applicant stating grounds for continuance of the above said Criminal Appeal.
5 As per the provision of the law as contained in Section 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, though it is a normal rule that every Appeal filed under Section 377 shall finally abate on the death of the accused, but so far as the appeal against conviction and sentence is concerned, if the appellant dies during the pendency of the appeal and within 30 days of the death of the appellant, his near relative applies to the appellate court for Leave to continue the appeal, the court may grant the Leave and thereupon the appeal shall not abate.
6 Having heard learned counsels for the parties and for the grounds mentioned in para-2 of the affidavit preferred by the present applicant that on account of conviction, his father was dismissed from service and, therefore, the appeal is required to be continued and Leave is sought for, we consider that this is a fit case in which Leave to continue the Appeal be granted.
7 In above view of matter, this Application is allowed. Present applicant is permitted to continue the appeal and Criminal Appeal No. 1010 of 1985 shall not abate and be continued as aforesaid. Rule is made absolute.
