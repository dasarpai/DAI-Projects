                                                       ORDER
Background
1. The Applicant filed an RTI Application dt.30.8.11 with the PIO, Home Department, GNCTD seeking  documents and also permission to  inspect certain files dealing with her promotion case ( numbers  indicated   in   the   RTI   application)  against  seven  points.    On  not  receiving  any  reply,  she  filed  a  complaint dt.7.10.11 before CIC.
Decision
2. During the hearing, the Respondents submitted that information has been provided  on 30.9.11 which  the Appellant admitted to having received on 12.10.11.   The Respondents stated that out of the  seven files against point (a) five files are under submission to Directorate of Vigilance.  They further  submitted that the files had been further sent to office of the Chief Secretary.  The Appellant refuted  this statement  by stating that her files were sent to the Directorate of Vigilance only after the Public  Authority had received her RTI application, on 5.9.11 in an effort to harm her promotional chances.  She added that no information has been provided to her even after the file mentioned against point 
(a)(vii), was returned to the Public Authority by the Directorate of Vigilance on 16.9.11.   
3. The Respondents at this stage pointed out that they have already initiated action with regard to the  promotion of the Appellant and that in this connection, a new file, after taking on it the approval of the  LG to include the Appellant's name in the promotion list ,   had been sent to the vigilance for their  clearance. They further added that the vigilance had made certain observations after which the file  has been sent to the Chief Secretary who is also the Chief Vigilance officer,  for his final decision on  the matter.  
4. The Appellant who was informed about the present status of her promotion case for the first time,  during the hearing, decided not to pursue the matter in the RTI application until such time that she  receives the Chief Secretary's final decision. Since according to the Respondents the final decision is  expected   to   be  taken   within  a   week,    the  PIO    may   provide  all the information  sought  by the  Appellant  within 15 days of the issuance of the final decision by the Chief Secretary, irrespective of  whether the decision is in favour of the Appellant or not..
5. The Commission also directs the PIO to show cause as to why the five files mentioned in the PIO's  reply  dt.30.9.11  had  been  forwarded to  Directorate  of Vigilance  after they  had  received  the RTI  application .   The PIO to also inform in his explanation the date of receipt of the file mentioned  against point (a)(vii) from the Directorate of Vigilance.   He is directed to submit his written response  to the Commission, with a copy to the Appellant  by 1.12.11.
6. The appeal is disposed of with the above directions.
