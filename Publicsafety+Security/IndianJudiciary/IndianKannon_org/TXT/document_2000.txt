                 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                          CR APPL (DB) No 632 of 2011
                                 Arvind Singh
                                    Versus
                               The State Of Bihar
                                   -----------
3 04.08.2011 Heard the learned counsel for the appellant, informant and APP.
Having perused the record and heard the argument at length, we are not satisfied that it is a case for bail so far as appellant is concerned. The prosecution evidence is clear that it is appellant who fired the first shot at the neck of the deceased which went right through.
In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to grant bail to the appellant. Prayer for bail of appellant is rejected for the present.
    M.E.H./                                    (Navaniti Prasad Singh)
