                              THE STATE OF BIHAR
                                      -----------
2. 30.03.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the state.
The petitioner seeks bail in a case instituted for the offence under Sections 364 (A) of the Indian Penal Code.
Considering that there was material that the victim was confined in the house of the petitioner for purposes of ransom for one day, I am not inclined to review the earlier order dated 14.12.2009 vide Cr. Misc. No. 33164/2009 and dated 27.7.2010 vide Cr. Misc. No. 21108/2010.
Prayer for bail is rejected.
However, the Trial Court is directed to take expedient steps to ensure the attendance of the co- accused persons who have released on bail including cancelling their bail on account of non-appearance so that there is no further delay in trial.
      Fahad.                                      ( Anjana Prakash, J.)
