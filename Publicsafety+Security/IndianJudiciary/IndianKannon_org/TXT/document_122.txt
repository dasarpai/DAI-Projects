ORDER
It was argued by Ms. Contractor that certain facts of the matter were admitted, on behalf of the respondent, by filing an affidavit of Mr. B.L.Desai, Police Sub-Inspector, DCB Police Station, Surat, and that it is at page No. 83 onwards. However, perusing the record of the case, no such affidavit is found on record. Therefore, the respondent is required to see to it that the record of the Court is complete for the purpose of final hearing. Hearing is adjourned for that purpose.
