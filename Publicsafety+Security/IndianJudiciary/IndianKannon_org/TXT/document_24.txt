                 W.P.(C) NO. 33911 OF 2007 K
               =====================

         Dated this the 16th day of November, 2007

                        J U D G M E N T
Although Exts. P4 and P5 appeals filed by the petitioner in relation to the assessment years 1996-97 and 1997-98 have been heard on 19/10/2007, orders have not been passed till date. However, in the meantime, Ext.P7 notice has been issued under the Revenue Recovery Act and hence this writ petition.
2. Now that appeals itself have been heard and orders have been reserved by the 2nd respondent, I deem it appropriate that further proceedings pursuant to Ext.P7 should be deferred until orders are pronounced in the appeals.
3. Accordingly, I direct that the 2nd respondent shall pass orders on Exts. P4 and P5 appeals, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within four weeks of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
4. In the meantime, further proceedings pursuant to WPC 33911/07 Ext.P7 will stand deferred.
Petitioner shall produce copy of this judgment before the 2nd respondent for compliance.
Writ petition is disposed of as above.
ANTONY DOMINIC, JUDGE.
