The petitioner is the complainant in a crime registered as 238/CR/Admn/PTN/05. Investigation into that crime is in progress. On the complaint of the petitioner, the investigation was handed over to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, CBCID, SIG-1, Thiruvananthapuram as per order of the Director General of Police. Investigation is being conducted which has not come to completion. Final report has not been filed so far. The petitioner has come to this Court with a grievance that the investigation may be handed over to any superior officer of the Crime Branch, Kerala.
2. Statement has been filed by the investigating officer. The statement of the investigating officer reveals that the investigation is almost complete and final report shall be filed within a short period of time.
WPC.18214/07
3. I am, in these circumstances, satisfied that it is not necessary to issue any directions in the matter which is pending investigation by the Deputy Superintendent of Police now. The Deputy Superintendent of Police shall complete the investigation and file the final report. If the decision were against the petitioner, obviously the petitioner shall be given notice by the learned Magistrate before whom the petitioner shall be entitled to raise all her objections against such final report. I am satisfied that no further directions are necessary in this petition.
4. This writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
