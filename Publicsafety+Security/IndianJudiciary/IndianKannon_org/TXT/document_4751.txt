He was diredted to present himself before the Commission on 5 January 2010 at 12 p.m. along with his written submissions to show cause why penalty should not be imposed on him as mandated under Section 20 (1).
Relevant facts arose during the show cause hearing held on 05/01/2010: The following persons were present :
Appellant: Absent Respondent: Dr. Y Kumar During the show cause hearing on 05/01/2010, Dr. Y. Kumar submitted that he had forwarded the First Appellate Authority's order dated 06/08/2009 to the Head Clerk on 07/08/2009 with a note that the information should be provided to the Appellant within 7 days. After that the file was not put up to him and it was only on receiving the order of the Commission dated 07/12/2009 that he provided the information.
The Commission therefore decided to schedule another hearing on 02/02/2010 at 11 a.m. to apportion the responsibility of delay between persons. A show cause notice dated 05/01/2010 was issued to Dr. Y Kumar, Mr. ML Sharma, Head Clerk and Mr. KC Nirwan, UDC. Relevant facts arising during the show cause hearing held on 02/02/2010: The following persons were present :
Appellant: Mr. Maan Singh;
Respondent: Dr.Y.Kumar PIO, Mr. M.L.Sharma(Head Clerk), Mr. KC Nirwan UDC, Mr. Dharam Pal LDC (Diary Dispatcher);
Mr. M.L. Sharma Head Clerk states that he received the First Appellate Authority's order on 07/08/2009 and he immediately forwarded it to the UDC Mr. Nirwan. Mr. Nirwan states that he never received a copy of the Order. Mr. Dharam Pal submits that he handed over the order to Mr. Nirwan. Mr. Nirwan first told the Commission that the information was not held by him. When asked by the Commission why he did not point this out to the Head Clerk he stated that he may not have received the application. Mr. ML Sharma positively stated that he had given the RTI application to Mr. Dharam Pal to affirm that he had given the RTI application to Mr. Nirwan. Mr. Nirwan again took the position that he may not have received the RTI application. Mr. Nirwan when asked for the reasons for the delay states that he is not sure when the paper was mixed with other papers. The LDC Mr. Dharam Pal states that this paper has been attached very clearly by UDC Mr. Nirwan with the file. From the deposition of Mr. Sharma, Mr. Nirwan Page no. 2 of 3 and Mr. Dharam Pal it appears that the RTI application had been given to Mr. Nirwan on 07/08/2009 and he has been negligent in providing the information for this. Mr. Nirwan is not able to give any reasonable explanation for not giving information in time. He only keeps saying that the head clerk had marked the application wrongly to him whereas the information should have been with some other UDC. If the information was not with him he should have immediately returned the RTI application to the head clerk. The information has finally been given to the Appellant on 14/12/2009. The RTI application appears to have been given to Mr. Nirwan on 07/08/2009 and the information was provided to the Appellant on 14/12/2009.Sicne the delay is over 100 days and it appears that the responsibility is rest with Mr. Nirwan. The Commission orders levy of penalty on Mr. Nirwan, UDC of Rs.25000/- which is the maximum penalty under the Act.
