This writ petition is filed challenging Exhibit P8 order passed by the Government. The first petitioner is the Teacher appointed and the second petitioner is the Manager of the School. It is brought to my notice that the Government as per G.O.(P) No.174/2008/G.Edn dated 06.10.2008 introduced an amendment to proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 6B of Chapter XXIII of Kerala Education Rules. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners may be granted permission to challenge the said amendment and with liberty to do so, the writ petition may be closed. Permission is granted and this writ petition is closed.
