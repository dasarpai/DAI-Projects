RAJESH BINDAL, J.
Petition qua petitioner No.1 was dismissed as not pressed vide order dated 13.9.2011.
Learned counsel for petitioners No.2 and 3 submitted that in terms of the statement made by him on 13.09.2011, petitioner No.1, to whom grievous injury has been attributed has already surrendered and is in custody. Injuries attributed to petitioners No.2 and 3 are found to be simple.
Learned counsel for the State did not dispute the aforesaid facts.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and considering that petitioner No.1, to whom grievous injury is attributed, has already been arrested, in my opinion, petitioners No. 2 and 3 are not required to be taken into custody for interrogation. They are directed to appear before the Inves- tigating Officer on 30.09.2011 at 10.00 a.m. to join investigation and in case of arrest, they shall be released on furnishing of bail bonds to the satisfac- tion of the Investigating Officer. They shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when called upon for further investigation. They shall also be bound by all the conditions as contained in Section 438 (2) Cr.P.C.
The petition stands disposed of.
