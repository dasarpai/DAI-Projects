                          Dated 21st May, 2009

                                JUDGMENT
Heard Sri.T.V.George, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners.
2. The petitioners are Live Stock Inspectors appointed under Rule 9(a)(i) of Part II of the Kerala State & Subordinate Services Rules. They claim continuance in service till regular hands recruited by the Kerala Public Service Commission join duty. The issue raised in this writ petition is directly covered against the petitioners by the decision of the Full Bench of this Court in Radha v. District Medical Officer (2002 (2) KLT 711). The Full Bench of this Court has in the aforesaid decision held that employees appointed under Rule 9(a)(i) of Part II of the Kerala State & Subordinate Services Rules have no right to continue in service beyond the term for which they were appointed. Further, the 9th proviso to Rule 9(a)(i) of Part II of the KS & SSR interdicts such continuance in service. In the light of the authoritative pronouncement of the Full Bench of this Court and the stipulations in the 9th proviso to Rule 9(a)(i) of Part II of the KS & SSR, the petitioners cannot seek or be granted the reliefs prayed for in this writ petition. Further, the learned Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submits on instructions that a list of candidates sponsored by Employment Exchanges has been forwarded to various appointing authorities as early as on 8.5.2009. For that reason also the petitioners cannot seek or be granted the reliefs prayed for in this writ petition. The writ petition fails and is accordingly dismissed in limine.
