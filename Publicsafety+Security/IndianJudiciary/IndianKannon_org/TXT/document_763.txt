The landowner is in appeal before this court against the order of the learned court below seeking enhancement of compensation for the acquired land.
Briefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide notification dated 10.11.1982 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 (for short, "the Act"), acquired the land situated in revenue estate of Village Mewala Maharajpur, Tehsil Ballabgarh, District Faridabad. The Land Acquisition Collector announced his award. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below vide order dated 24.10.1992, determined the market value of the acquired land @ Rs. 22/- per square yard.
Learned counsel for the parties do not dispute that the claim made in the appeal is squarely covered by judgment of this court in R. F. A. No. 1758 of 1988 Parmal vs State of Haryana, decided on 25.5.2005, whereby the award of the Reference Court was upheld. The amount of compensation assessed in the present case is also in the same terms. Accordingly, the claim made in the appeal does not survive.
For the reasons recorded in Parmal's case (supra), the present appeal is dismissed.
17.12.2008                                                 ( Rajesh Bindal)
vs.                                                              Judge
