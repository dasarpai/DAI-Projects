Patna High Court - Orders
Guddu Mishra vs State Of Bihar on 25 June, 2010
              IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                        Cr.Misc. No.16857 of 2010
               GUDDU MISHRA S/O LATE YOGENDRA MISHRA
                                  Versus
                            STATE OF BIHAR
                                 -----------
3. 25-06-2010 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The petitioner seeks bail in a case instituted for the offence under sections 376,341,323,354/34 of the Indian Penal Code.
It has been submitted that the informant has said that "Bura Kaam" had been done with her, which does not mean rape and the medical report does not support the prosecution case, and the police has submitted charge sheet under section 376, 511 I.P.C.
Considering that there is direct allegation of rape alleged against the petitioner, both by the informant and her husband, I am not inclined to grant the bail to the petitioner.
Prayer for bail is rejected.
The Trial Court is directed to expedite in view of the serious nature of the offence.
     Fahad.                                     ( Anjana Prakash, J.)
