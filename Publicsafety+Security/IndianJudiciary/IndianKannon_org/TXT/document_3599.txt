             Dated this the 25th day of May, 2010

                          JUDGMENT
Pius C.Kuriakose, J.
Even though various grounds have been raised assailing the judgment of the Reference Court, having scanned the impugned judgment, we are of the view that it is more or less the correct market value of the property that has been arrived at by the learned Sub Judge. In fact, this case was referred to Lok Adalat hoping that it will be possible to settle the issue between the parties upon the Government paying the amount as decreed by the court below as on the date of filing of the appeal within a short period. The settlement did not materialise since the claimant was absent.
2. Under the above circumstances, we dismiss the appeal confirming the award of the court below. However, we direct the Execution Court to explore the possibility of a settlement, before coercive process is issued in execution by directing the Government to deposit the amount due as on 1/8/2007 within a short time and reciprocally directing the claimant to receive that amount in full and final settlement.
The appeal stands dismissed with directions.
