Application for anticipatory bail. The petitioners apprehend that the first petitioner's wife has filed a complaint alleging offences punishable under Section 498A I.P.C. The learned Prosecutor reports that no crime is registered against the petitioners on the complaint of the wife of the first petitioner and the petitioners are not required to be arrested at the Kadakkal Police Station in connection with any crime. If the petitioners were to be arrested on any such allegations raised by the wife of the first petitioner of having committed any offence prior to this date, prior notice shall be given to the petitioners and prior permission of this Court shall be taken, submits the learned Prosecutor.
2. In the light of the submissions/undertaking, which I accept, the apprehension of the petitioners is found to be without any basis.
3. This application is accordingly dismissed as agreed.
