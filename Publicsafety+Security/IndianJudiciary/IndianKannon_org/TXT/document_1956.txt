            Dated this the 13th day of December, 2007

                                   ORDER
Application for regular bail. Petitioner faces allegations in a crime registered for offences punishable under Sections 420, 468 and 471 I.P.C. The petitioner had earlier come before this Court with an application for anticipatory bail and by common order dated 30.10.07 in B.A.Nos.6507 & 6508 of 2007, the said application was dismissed. The petitioner has subsequently surrendered on 29.11.07. He continues in custody from that date.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner prays, the learned Public Prosecutor does not oppose the said prayer and I am satisfied that the petitioner can be granted regular bail now subject to appropriate terms and conditions. I have already adverted to facts in detail in the common order dated 30.10.07. This order must be read in continuation of the said order. I am not hence adverting to facts in any greater detail in this order.
3. In the result, this application is allowed. The petitioner shall be released on bail on the following terms and conditions.
i) The petitioner shall execute a bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate;
ii) The petitioner shall make himself available for interrogation before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m and 12 noon on all Mondays and Fridays for a period of two months and thereafter as and when directed by the Investigating Officer in writing to do so.
Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.
