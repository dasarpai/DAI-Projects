                  Dated this, the 13th March, 2009.

                           J U D G M E N T
The petitioner is a retired employee of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation. He retired on 31-7-2008. He has filed this writ petition seeking a direction to the respondents to pay to the petitioner the balance retirement benefits due to him out of turn to enable him to pay off the housing loan due from him to the 2nd respondent.
Although, I sympathise with the petitioner, I do not think that the petitioner's request can be entertained. A Division Bench of this Court has already held that for the purpose of paying off loans, no out of turn payment of retirement benefits can be permitted. In the above circumstances, the writ petition is dismissed.
S. Siri Jagan, Judge.
