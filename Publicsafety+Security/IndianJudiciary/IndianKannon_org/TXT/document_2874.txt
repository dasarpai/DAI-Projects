Need To Stop The Proposed Establishment Of The Atomic Energy Factory ... on 14 December, 2006
> Title: Need to stop the proposed establishment of the Atomic Energy Factory at Kovvada village, Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh - laid.
  SHRI KINJARAPU YERRANNAIDU (SRIKAKULAM): It is learnt that the Government of India is thinking to establish a Atomic Energy Factory at Kovvada village of Ranastalam Mandal, Srikakulam district Andhra Pradesh state. Entire the area people worried about this factory, they are conducting Dharnas to stop the factory. It is very difficult to their livelihood. They are all living in thatched houses and they will go into the sea for the fish hunting. There is no any alternate for their living. In this connection, I request to Government of India to stop the proposal of establishing the Atomic Energy Factory in that area and save the people.
