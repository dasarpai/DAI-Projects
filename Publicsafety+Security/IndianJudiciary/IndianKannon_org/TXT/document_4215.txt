                      Bail Application No. 1872/2007

                                 O R D E R
The petitioners, mother and son, who are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime No.111/2007 of Paravur Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 451 and 354 IPC, seek anticipatory bail.
2. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that since both the offences are bailable offences, invocation of Section 438 Cr.P.C is misconceived.
3. This application is, therefore, dismissed without prejudice to the right of the petitioners to seek regular bail from the appropriate Court.
V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE mrcs
