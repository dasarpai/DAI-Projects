Petitioner submits that the 1st respondent has issued Ext.P1 patta dated 29/8/2001. According to the petitioner, while constructing the compound enclosing the property, it came to her knowledge that she was in possession of an excess area of .75 cents. It is stated that thereupon she filed Ext.P4 application before the 1st respondent requesting that the aforesaid excess area of .75 cents may be assigned to her. Orders have not been passed on the said application. However, in the meantime, petitioner apprehends that steps are being taken to dispossess her from the aforesaid land. It is in these circumstances, the writ petition has been filed.
2. The above being the grievance of the writ petitioner, at this stage, the appropriate order to be passed is to direct the 1st respondent to pass orders on Ext.P4 application for assignment keeping in abeyance further proceedings to dispossess the petitioner or to cause damage to the property in her possession.
