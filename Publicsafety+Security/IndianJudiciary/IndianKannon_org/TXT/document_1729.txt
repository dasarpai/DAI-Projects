Mobinak being a single ingredients formulation was exempted in excess of 10% duty vide notification No. 29/88 prior to issue of show cause cum demand notice dtd 4/5/94.
b) Three show cause cum demand notices were issued by the Range Superintendent C.

These notices were heard & dropped by A.C.C. Ex Mulund vide his order in original No. 502/503/97/98 dtd 28/11/97. However the notice dtd 8/4/94 issued by the Superintendent was not covered by the said order as the file was not available in the A.C. office.
c) Thereafter this fourth show cause cum demand notice dtd 4/5/94 was issued by the Commissioner of Central Excise covering the period April 89 to November 92 demanding differential duty under Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act 1944 read with Rule 9(2) of Central Excise Rules 1944 and for penalty under Rule 173Q and Rule 209A ibid. The notice alleged that M/s G.H.C.P.L in connivance of the appellant I) obtained provisional SSI certificates though M/s GHCPL had no factory of SSI anywhere in India as per the balance sheets, which was supported by the statements of the Directors of M/s GHCPL., recorded Under Section 14 of the C.Ex Act. II) the products Extragesic A.F. and mobinake (Exh.B) were belonging to M/s CRLL were manufactured by the appellant on behalf of M/s GHCPL. Therefore the appellant was not eligible for Exemption under notification No. 175/86. The appellant therefore, contravened the provisions of C.Ex. Rules & notification No. 175/86.
d) Replies to this fourth notice were filed however the Commissioner confirmed the duty demand and imposed penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs on the appellant and Rs. 5 lakhs on the loan licensee.

The Tribunal held that matter was required to be remanded back to the Commissioner after fresh decision considering that the order filed by the Honourable High Court Gujarat 1990 (50) ELT 210. Personal hearing was thereafter held the Commissioner vide the order now impugned rejected the submissions confirm the duty demand and also confirm the penalties as held in the earlier order.
