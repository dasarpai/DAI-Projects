2. Both the parties were present during the hearing in the Mumbai studio of  the NIC and made their submissions.
3. The  Appellant  had  sought two  sets of information  concerning  (a)  the  fixation of interest on home loan and (b) appeals filed against the decision of  the Ombudsman. The CPIO had provided some information against his queries.  The Appellate Authority had endorsed the decision of the CPIO. CIC/SM/A/2010/001082
4. During the hearing, the Appellant submitted that the information provided  was inadequate. He specifically pointed out that the reference to the website of  the bank was not helpful at all since the RBI website was too vast for anyone to  locate the exact information one needed. Similarly, he pointed out that certain  details   sought   by   him   about   the   appeals   filed   against   the   orders   of   the  Ombudsman before the Appellate Authority in the RBI had not been provided  on the plea that the RBI did not have it in the desired format.
5. After hearing the please and submissions of both the parties, we are of  the view that the CPIO should provide the following information:
a)   the   exact   link   in   the   website   relating   to   the   information   sought   by   the  Appellant or, if no such link is possible to be identified, the hard copy of the  relevant portions;
b) the photocopy of the register or the records listing the appeals against the  orders passed by the Ombudsman received during the preceding one year in  the office of the Appellate Authority.
6. The CPIO is directed to provide this information within 10 working days  from the receipt of this order.
7. The appeal is disposed off accordingly.
8. Copies of this order be given free of cost to the parties. CIC/SM/A/2010/001082 (Satyananda Mishra) Chief Information Commissioner Authenticated true copy.  Additional copies of orders shall be supplied against  application and payment of the charges prescribed under the Act to the CPIO of this  Commission.
