ORAL
ORDER
1.0 The applicant by this application has prayed for enlarging him on bail in connection with the offence registered before "B" Division Police Station as C.R.No. I-82 of 2006. This is a third successive bail application. Earlier two applications were disposed of as not pressed.
2.0 The present application is filed on the ground that the trial is delayed and the applicant is suffering from ailment of Haras and his physical condition is deteriorated. The applicant has also pointed out the progress of the trial.
3.0 Having heard the learned advocate for the applicant at length, I am of the view that the applicant has not made out any ground of regular bail in the present successive bail application. Hence, the application is rejected.
4.0 However, the trial Court is directed to take up the matter on to-today basis and conclude the trial at the earliest. The trial Court shall not transfer the proceedings of the trial nor send the record and proceedings to any Court, except to comply with the orders, if any, which may be passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In case the record of the case is necessary for any other proceedings, it will be open to the parties to produce certified copy of the Record and Proceedings, which shall be accepted by the court concerned.
