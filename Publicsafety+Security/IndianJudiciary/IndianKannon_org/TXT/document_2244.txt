                                                      ORDER
Background
1. The Applicants filed an RTI application dt.21.6.10 with the PIO, Western railway, Mumbai seeking the  following information:
i) names   of   the   stations   where   minimum  two  folding  stretchers  are  available  at   Western   Railway Mumbai division
ii) names of the stations where collapsible stretcher is available at Western Railway Mumbai   division
iii) To permit the Applicant or his representative to inspect the same at stations. The Sr.DOM replied on 3.9.10 as follows:
i) All suburban railway stations are having a provision of minimum two stretchers, but they are   not of folding type.
ii) Collapsible stretchers are not provided at any of the suburban stations.
iii) Applicant or his representative is permitted to inspect the same at the stations after duly   intimating the office.
The Applicant filed a complaint dt.21.10.10 before CIC stating that while the PIO had stated that  collapsible stretchers are not provided at any of the suburban stations, however in response to an  RTI application filed by Shri J.D.Sakpal, the Sr.DOM vide his letter dt.16.7.10 had stated that the  stretcher provided was collapsible.   He stated that the information furnished by the same PIO is  contradictory with each other.
Decision
2. During the hearing, the Appellant complained about the two contradictory replies provided by one  PIO in the case of Shri Sakpal and by   another   PIO, with reference to information sought about  availability of collapsible stretchers at Railway stations.  He stated that  in the earlier case(Sakpal) ,  wrong information was provided by the PIO deliberately to mislead the Appellant, when he stated that  a collapsible stretcher was used to remove the patient from the accident site.  His contention was that  the answer given by the PIO in the instant case that there are no collapsible stretchers in Western  Railway, Mumbai Division is correct.  The Respondent explained that  in Shri Sakpal's case the reply  furnished on 16.7.10 was furnished by a PIO  who was not able to comprehend what a collapsible  stretcher is.   He pointed out that he himself is not completely sure of what   a collapsible stretcher  looks like.  He also pointed out that in response to the second appeal dt.21.10.10, a  reply was again  furnished by the PIO on 27.10.10 wherein the PIO had admitted that   an inadvertent mistake was  made   by   him     in   the   information   provided   in   the   case   of   Shri   Sakpal,   regarding   availability   of  collapsible stretchers,  while stating  categorically that no collapsible stretcher has been provided to  the injured traveler and that what was used was an aluminum stretcher that was non­foldable.  
3. The Commission having noted the fact that the Appellant  sought no further information with respect  to the    RTI application, however directs the Sr.DOM­BCT to explain once again as to why against  item No. 10 of his reply dt.16.7.10 in response to the RTI application dt.3.7.10 of Shri J.D.Sakpal, he  had informed the Appellant that the stretcher provided was collapsible.  The explanation should reach  the Commission by 11.8.11 with a copy to the Appellant.  No further information to be authorized for  disclosure.
4. The complaint to continue.
