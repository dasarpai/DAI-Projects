Hon'ble Rakesh Tiwari,J.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned A.G.A. Sri K.N. Bajpai for the State and perused the record.
By this application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. the applicants have challenged the order dated 13.7.2009 by which they have been summoned in Case No.1349 of 2008.
Learned counsel for the applicants does not dispute the fact that the revision lies against the impugned summoning order. The present application under section 482 Cr.P.C. is, therefore, dismissed on the ground of availability of alternative remedy.
