Hon'ble Raj Mani Chauhan,J.

Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, learned A.G.A and perused the FIR. This petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the petitioners for quashing the impugned FIR registered in case crime 761 of 2010, under Sections 2/3 (1) U.P. Gangsters Act at Police Station Makhi, District Unnao and also for direction to the opposite parties not to arrest the petitioners in pursuance to the said impugned FIR. Learned counsel for the petitioners informs that petitioner No. 3 has already been surrendered before the court concerned, therefore, he does not want to press the petition on his behalf.
The petition is, therefore, dismissed as not pressed with regard to petitioner No.3, Surendera.
The allegations made in the FIR disclose the commission of cognizable offence mentioned therein, therefore no ground to quash the FIR lodged by the complainant against the petitioners is made out.
The petition is, therefore, dismissed.
However, it is observed that in case the petitioners No. 1 and 2 appear before the court concerned and apply for bail, the same shall be considered and disposed of by the courts below expeditiously.
