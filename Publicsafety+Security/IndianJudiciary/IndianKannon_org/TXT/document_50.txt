ORAL
ORDER
In this matter the Hon'ble Court (Coram:Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.M. Thaker) passed an order on 01.07.2008 and directed to examine the documents and also identify the persons who have executed the said power of attorney. Manojbhai Ranchodbhai Mahida and Ranchodbhai Jivabhai Mahida appeared before me and they have given deposition on oath and stated that Ranchodbhai Jivabhai Mahida given power of attorney to Manojbhai Ranchodbhai Mahida. In the said matter disputed property in question and caveat was filed by the Learned Advocate Ms. Subhadraben Patel and thereafter she was already relieved and therefore on behalf of Mr. H. Ahmed was represented by legal aid and he also relived and then Mr. Chirag was appointed through the legal aid, even though he was also relieved.
The applicant wants to plead as party in person and for which the application was made by the applicant in this matter. Advocate has not appeared on behalf of the applicant in which it cannot be identified that who are Manojbhai Ranchodbhai Mahida and Ranchodbhai Jivabhai Mahida. Only we can say that the oral depositions were given on oath before this Court and it can be gather that the applicant wants to plead as party in person. So the matter be placed before the Hon'ble Court for necessary order.
