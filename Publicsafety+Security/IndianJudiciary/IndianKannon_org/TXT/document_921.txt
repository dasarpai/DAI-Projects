Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan, J.
Petitioner is the mother of the divorced wife of the 5th respondent. Proceedings are pending or have ended before the Family Court. There are some proceedings in other jurisdictions also. The complaint of the petitioner is that she is being harassed and subjected to threats against her life to pressurize settlement of litigation. There is already an interim order granted by this Court on 28.1.2011, directing respondents 2 to 4 to afford adequate police protection for the petitioner . On facts, we are satisfied that continuance of the said order as an absolute order is justified and that by itself would render justice to the parties since other reliefs are not matters to be debated upon or adjudicated herein.
2. Hence we direct respondents 2 to 4 to provide adequate police protection to the petitioner. Obviously the issuance of this order will in no manner be used to harass the fifth respondent.
Writ petition ordered accordingly.
