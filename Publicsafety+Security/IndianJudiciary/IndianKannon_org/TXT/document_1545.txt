                      W.P(C) No.17053 of 2009-B
                  ------------------------------
                Dated this the 19th day of June, 2009.

                             J U D G M E N T
The petitioner is presently working as Junior Public Health Nurse in Idukki District. She had applied for transfer to Pathanamthitta District. When Ext.P3 preliminary list was published, the petitioner's name was included therein and she was tentatively transferred to and posted at Primary Health Center, Enadimangalam. The petitioner's grievance is that when Ext.P4 final list was issued she was excluded from the list. In this writ petition, the petitioner seeks a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to transfer and post her in Pathanamthitta District. Seeking the said relief, the petitioner has moved the Secretary to Government, Health & Family Welfare Department by submitting Ext.P5 representation. Since the petitioner has already moved the Government complaining about the denial of transfer to her, I am of the opinion that the petitioner should pursue the said remedy instead of seeking the intervention of this Court.
I accordingly dispose of this writ petition with a direction to the Secretary, Health & Family Welfare Department to consider the request made by the petitioner in Ext.P5 and pass orders thereon within two months from the date on which the petitioner produces a certified copy of this judgment, along with a copy of the writ petition.
