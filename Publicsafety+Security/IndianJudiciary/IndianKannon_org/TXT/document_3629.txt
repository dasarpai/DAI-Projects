                               JUDGMENT
Petitioner is aggrieved by Ext.P2 demand made by the Panchayat in the matter of auction amount of the river sand. Learned Government Pleader submits that it is open to the petitioner to approach the District Collector since the levy is on the ground of non- compliance with the conditions of the agreement executed by the petitioner with the second respondent. In the event of the petitioner approaching the District Collector within a period of two months from today the matter will be duly considered by the District Collector with notice to the petitioner and the 3rd respondent and appropriate action in accordance with law in the matter will be taken within another two months. The interim order passed by this court will continue till such time.
The writ petition is disposed of as above.
