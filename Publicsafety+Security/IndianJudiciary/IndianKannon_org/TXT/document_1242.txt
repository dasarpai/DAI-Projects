Hon'ble Amitava Lala,J.
Hon'ble Shri Kant Tripathi,J.
None appeared to press the petition in spite of repeated calls. It seems that the writ petition has become infructuous by the passage of time, as such the petitioner has lost interest.
Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed as infructuous without imposing any cost.
Interim order, if any, stands vacated.
Order Date :- 18.1.2010 MTA
