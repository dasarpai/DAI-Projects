Order No. 04 Dated 17th September, 2011 This application has been filed under section 378(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking permission for filing acquittal appeal against the impugned judgment passed by the learned Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Court, Dhanbad in C.P. No. 130 of 2005.
After considering the respective cases of the parties and materials brought on record by them in detail, learned trial court inter-alia held that as the marriage could not be solemnized between the O.P. No. 2-Md. Aftab Alam and the petitioner, this case was lodged under section 376 IPC. It has also been found that several criminal cases were going on between the parties; and that the case was instituted after long delay of about three months. Learned trial court has rightly appreciated the materials on record. No grounds are made out for grant of leave. Accordingly, this application is dismissed.
