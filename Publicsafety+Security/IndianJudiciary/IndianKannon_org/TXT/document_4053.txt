ORAL
ORDER
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.R.VORA) Rule.
Waived by learned APP Ms.Raval.
This application is preferred by the convict prisoner through jail to release him on temporary bail of 30 days to bring his blind daughter from the hostel and to stay with her during Diwali vacation.
On going through the jail remarks, it is found that the applicant was released on furlough from 1.3.2008 to 14.3.2008 and then again on temporary bail for the cause mentioned in the application from 1.5.2008 to 10.5.2008.
In this view of the matter, we do not find it expedient to release the applicant on temporary bail for the ground mentioned in the application and for bringing the daughter of the applicant, the applicant may make necessary arrangement.
In view of the above, this application stands dismissed. Rule discharged.
