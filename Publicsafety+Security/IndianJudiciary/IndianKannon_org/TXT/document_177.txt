Balakrishnan Nair, J.
Nobody appeared for the appellants. Though this Court ordered to condone the delay on condition of payment of Rs.500/- to the Kerala High Court Legal Services Committee within one month, so far, the said payment has not been made. Therefore, the petition to condone the delay is dismissed. As a result, the Writ Appeal is also dismissed.
