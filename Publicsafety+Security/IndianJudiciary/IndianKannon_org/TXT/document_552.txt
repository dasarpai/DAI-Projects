ORDER
F.A.
NO. 3123 OF 2010 Heard learned advocates for the parties. Appeal ADMITTED.
C.A.
NO. 12140 OF 2010 Heard learned AGP for the applicant. Rule. Mr. K.M. Sheth, learned advocate waives service of notice of rule for respondent.
Looking to the fact that the appeal is admitted, this application requires consideration. The interest of justice would be served if the appellant/applicant State is called upon to deposit the entire amount awarded with interest & cost with the Reference Court within a period of eight (8) weeks from today, and on receipt of said amount, Reference Court shall deposit the same in a nationalised bank. The said amount would be subject to the order that may be passed hereafter.
It is open to the respondent claimant to make an appropriate application with regard to disbursement or deposit that may be deemed fit. If the said application is not made within 30 days from depositing the amount, the Reference Court shall deposit the same in a nationalised bank in a cumulative deposit initially for a period of six years and it shall be renewed thereafter so as to inure interest till final disposal of the First Appeal.
Civil application is disposed of accordingly and rule is made absolute. No costs.
