                       ----------------------------------
7. 17.10.2011. Since both the appeals arise out of the common order, both the appeals are being disposed of by the common order.
The present appeals have been preferred under Section 299 of India Succession Act against an order dated 22.10.2009 passed in Probate Case No.17 of 2007 by A.D.J./F.T.C. Vth, Lakhisarai, whereby the prayer of the appellants for intervention was dismissed.
Shri Umesh Prasad Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.2, while referring to averment made in paragraph-6 of the affidavit filed on behalf of respondent no.2 submits that during pendency of the present appeals, the probate case has already been decided by judgment dated 30.6.2010. He further points out that a suit vide Title Suit No.76 of 2010 has been preferred for declaration of the title and confirmation of possession and same is also pending.
In view of the fact that during pendency of the present appeals, the probate case has already been decided, no purpose would be served in keeping the matter pending, which were filed primarily for setting aside of an order whereby prayer for intervention/addition of party of the appellant in probate case was rejected.
The court is of the opinion that both the appeals have now become infructuous.
Accordingly, both the appeals stand disposed of.
