an> Title : Frequent extension of ceasefire with the NSCN to bring peace to the North Eastern Region.
SHRI TAPIR GAO (ARUNACHAL EAST): Mr. Chairman, Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the Government of India to the frequent extension of cease-fire with the NSCN (IM) and (K) to bring peace to the North-Eastern Region. This is a long-pending case over a decade now. The cease-fires are frequently being extended. We welcome that move on behalf of the people of the North-East to bring peace to the North-Eastern Region. 
            I would like to draw the attention of the Government of India to infuse  political will to solve the problems of the Naga issue amicably so that there will be lasting peace in the North-Eastern Region. The underground activity has got links with all other States of the North-Eastern Region. So, unless and until the Government of India infuses a political will to solve this issue, there will be no peace. Therefore, I draw the attention of the Government of India to infuse a political will - like what happened in Mizoram  - in respect of Nagaland also so that we can see peace in future. Thank you.
