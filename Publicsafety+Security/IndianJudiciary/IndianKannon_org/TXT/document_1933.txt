The petitioner prays for provisional release of the Bikram Tempo bearing Registration No.BR04PA-1698, Engine No. R6H2809008, Chassis No. MEDAPIMPLBO1H-8395, which has been seized in connection with Town P.S. Case No. 586 of 2018 for the offences punishable under Section 30 (a) of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016.
It is stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that Patna High Court CWJC No.24348 of 2018 dt.26-04-2019 confiscation proceeding is yet to be initiated and the vehicle is lying under the open sky in the police station. The seizure list reflects the seizure of 90 liters of country made liquor.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and taking note of the nature of seizure made as well as the fact that the confiscation proceeding is yet to be initiated, we direct that the vehicle in question be released provisionally in favour of the petitioner on production of ownership and registration with respect to vehicle in question in his name before the designated Court below with one surety along with a Bank Guarantee or original title deed of immovable property situated within the district to the extent of the value of the vehicle as indicated in the insurance document. The petitioner while submitting the surety and the bank guarantee or the original title deed, as the case may be, shall also furnish the following affidavits / undertakings:
(i) That the vehicle in question has never been involved in any offence of similar nature in past and shall not indulge in similar offence in future.
(ii) That the petitioner shall not indulge in creating any third party right or interest in respect of the vehicle during the Patna High Court CWJC No.24348 of 2018 dt.26-04-2019 pendency of the confiscation proceeding, if any, and shall not alienate the vehicle during this period.
(iii) The petitioner shall furnish an undertaking to produce the vehicle before the Confiscating Authority as and when required.
(iv) Prior to release of the vehicle, a Panchanama would be got prepared by the designated Court below, wherein the photograph of the vehicle shall be taken and will be certified by the petitioner and the same shall be kept on record so that in future, if so required, it may be used as a secondary evidence. The petitioner shall furnish an undertaking not to challenge the said Panchanama in course of trial.
The release shall be allowed within a period of 14 days from the date of production of ownership/registration papers supporting the claim of the petitioner together with one surety along with the bank guarantee to the extent of the value of the vehicle as indicated in the insurance amount and the undertakings as stated above. This release of the vehicle would, however, be subject to initiation and finalization of the confiscation proceeding. The title deed papers shall remain in safe custody of the designated Court below subject to final Patna High Court CWJC No.24348 of 2018 dt.26-04-2019 decision in the confiscation proceedings.
With the observations/directions above, this writ petition is allowed.
