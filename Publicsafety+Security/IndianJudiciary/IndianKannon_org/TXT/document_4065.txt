The writ petition is filed by the judgment debtor in E.P.378 of 2007 in O.S.No.226 of 2004 on file of the Munsiff Court, Kodungallur. Though in the writ petition some directions have been sought for in relation to A.S.No.199 of 2006 on the file of the Sub Court, Thrissur and also I.P.No.3 of 2008 on the file of the same court, at the time of hearing learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he is confining his relief for a direction only in respect of the execution petition pending before the Munsiff Court, Kodungallur. Respondent is the decree holder in the decree which is being executed before that court. The grievance canvassed by the petitioner is that despite informing the court that he has filed a insolvency proceedings as I.P.No.3 of 2008 to declare him as an insolvent, the execution court issued a warrant for the reason that he did not appear on the posting date of the execution petition.
2. I heard the counsel for the petitioner and also the respondent/decree holder.
W.P.(C).No.9121 of 2009 - O
3. By virtue of an interim order passed by this Court, the execution of the warrant has been kept in abeyance.

The stay granted by the court directing the keeping in abeyance of the execution of the warrant shall continue to be in force till the above question is considered by the execution court and appropriate orders passed in accordance with law.
Subject to the above observation, the writ petition is closed.
