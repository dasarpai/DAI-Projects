Delhi High Court
P.R. Industries vs C.E.G.A.T. on 10 February, 1999

Bench: A Kumar, M Sarin
JUDGMENT
1. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. On the question of financial hardship the learned counsel for the petitioner admits that the turn-over of the petitioner is about rupees one crore per year. However, the net profit shown to the share of the partners is about Rs. 7,000/-. To say the least this does not inspire confidence. Petitioner has not come to Court with clean hands. We would not like to interfere with the discretion exercised by the Tribunal.
2. Dismissed
3. Interim order stands vacated.
