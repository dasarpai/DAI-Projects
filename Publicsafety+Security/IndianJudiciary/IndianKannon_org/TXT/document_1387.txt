Hon'ble Shri Narayan Shukla,J.
C.M.Application No.40 (W) of 2000 the applicants/opposite parties 3 and 4 submitted that the petitioner No.1 has expired on 9th of June, 1990, but till date no application for substitution has been filed to substitute his legal heirs in his place. So far as petitioner No.2 is concerned the writ petition has not been presented on his behalf as neither his signature is thereon on the 'Vakalatnama' nor on affidavit. Accordingly he submits that the writ petition is abated and is liable to be dismissed.
Upon perusal of the record I find force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, therefore, keeping in view the aforesaid facts I hereby dismiss the writ petition.
