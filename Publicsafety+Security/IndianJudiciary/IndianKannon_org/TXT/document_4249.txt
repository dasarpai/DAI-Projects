Background
1. The Applicant filed an RTI application dt.5.3.10 with the PIO, DRM Office, Western Railway, Mumbai. 
He stated that he is working in HBCDTS and that despite the Order of the Court, the attendant  benefits have not been   given to him even after 3 years after the judgment.  He added that in this  connection, he had  lodged  a complaint and that no  response was received by him.  Besides this  he  also sought information relating to his seniority and pay fixation.   On not receiving any reply, the  Applicant   filed   an   appeal   dt.23.4.10   with   the   Appellate   Authority   reiterating   his   request   for   the  information.   Shri Anil Kumar Jha, Appellate Authority replied on 2.6.10 stating that information as  available  in   material  form   can   be  provided  and  that  Applicant  has  sought  answers  to  questions  prefixed with 'why', 'what', 'when', 'where' etc.  Being aggrieved with the reply,  he Applicant filed a  second appeal dt.10.8.10 before CIC.
Decision
2. During the hearing, the Appellant submitted that he is only in knowing whether seniority is one of the  components of the attendant benefits mentioned para 1 haereinabove.   Ms.Rekha Yadav, Respondent PIO  submitted that though the Appellant had not sought this information in his RTI application she is willing to hold  a personal hearing with the Appellant and provide the required clarification. 
3. In   view   of   the   Respondent's   assurance     that   the   Appellant's   grievance   will   be   looked   into,   the  Commission holds that there is no further obligation on the part of the  PIO, to provide any further  information  and accordingly  closes the case at the  Commission's end.
