02. 18.03.2011. Heard.
Regard being had to the fact that the petitioner has misused the privilege of bail in a case under Section 364 of the IPC by remaining absent from the trial for over 13 years, the court is not inclined to direct his release from the custody. Prayer is dismissed.
B.Kr. ( Dharnidhar Jha,J.)
