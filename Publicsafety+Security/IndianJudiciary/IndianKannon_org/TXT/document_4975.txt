                  W.P.(C) No.14771 OF 2006
               ---------------------------------------
         Dated this the 24th day of September, 2008.


                          J U D G M E N T
Exhibit P1 order passed by the fourth respondent is under challenge. According to the petitioner-panchayath, the dispute essentially is of a civil nature. The fourth respondent, without properly understanding the factual and legal position, has issued a direction to the petitioner-panchayath to demolish the fish market under dispute on the ground that the same is constructed trespassing into the property of the fifth respondent. Apparently, the dispute does not come under Sections 271F and 271J of the Kerala Panchayath Raj Act. There is an express bar also under Section 271M of the Act.
2. Therefore, Exhibit P1 is quashed without prejudice to the liberty to the fifth respondent to approach the Civil Court for redressal of his grievances. Needless to say that in the event of the fifth respondent approaching the Civil Court as above, in case there is any question of limitation, the time taken by the fifth respondent for prosecuting the matter before the fourth respondent and the period of pendency of the writ petition shall also be excluded.
This writ petition is disposed of as above.
