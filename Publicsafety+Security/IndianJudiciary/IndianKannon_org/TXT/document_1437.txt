Facts
: -
The Commission has received a complaint from Ms S. Radhamony of Madurai, Tamilnadu that her request under RTI Act, 2005 seeking information regarding action taken on the request sent to PM Dr Manmohan Singh by Dr KS Manoj, MP on 20.2.'07 for getting help for a 9 year old child Reshma, submitted to Central Public Information Officer, Prime Minister's Office, New Delhi, has not been responded to, even though the same was duly submitted along with the requisite fee on 22.10.2007.
Having admitted the complaint of Ms. Radhamony u/s 18(1)(b) of the RTI Act, 2005 the Commission served notice on 09.09.2009 on the CPIO, Prime Minister's Office, New Delhi for furnishing comments on the complaint. In her response of 24.09.2009, the CPIO Ms. Sanjukta Ray, Deputy Secretary submitted her comments endorsing a copy also to the complainant Ms S. Radhamony. The CPIO has informed the Commission that as per the available record the application of the complainant dated 22.10.2007 has not been received by them. She has further informed that only one letter dated nil was received from the complainant on 22.11.2007, which was not an application under the RTI Act and accordingly was disposed of as per approved guidelines in that office. No rejoinder has been received from the complainant against the comments submitted by the CPIO. When contacted on the telephone, however Ms Radhamony informed the Registry that she has proof of delivery of her RTI application.
Decision Notice It is clear from the comments received from CPIO, PMO that as per the available records no application under Right to Information Act has been received by the CPIO, Prime Minister's Office from Ms Radhamony, except a letter which was received on 22.11.2007, which was not an application under the RTI Act. There has however been no appeal u/s 19 (1) of the Act. Because the 1st appellate authority has not addressed the questions of appellant, which are of direct concern to her public authority given complainant's insistence that she has indeed submitted a request under RTI as claimed, the Commission has decided to remand this complaint to Appellate Authority Ms Vini Mahajan, JS, PMO, to dispose of the appeal of Ms S Radhamony within ten working days from the date of receipt of this decision, under intimation to Shri Pankaj Shreyaskar, Jt Registrar, Central Information Commission.
Announced this tenth day of December 2009. Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the parties.
(Wajahat Habibullah) Chief Information Commissioner) 10.12.2009 Authenticated true copy. Additional copies of orders shall be supplied against application and payment of the charges prescribed under the Act to the CPIO of this Commission.
