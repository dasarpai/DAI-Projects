                                                       ORDER
Background
1. The Applicant, through his RTI­application dated 06.01.2011, filed with the PIO, East Central Railway,  Danapur, wanted to know: whether the amount of pension being paid to him is correct; if not, then  why it has not yet been corrected; by what time it would be corrected; when would he get the full  payment. The  PIO,  on 06.01.2011, gave an interim reply to the Applicant informing him that his  request   for   information   has   been   forwarded   to   the   concerned   sections   for   response.   Since   the  Applicant did not receive the desired information within the stipulated time period, he filed his 1 st­ appeal with the Appellate Authority (AA) on 17.02.2011 which was apparently not decided by the AA. 
The   Appellant,   therefore,   filed   the   present   petition   dated   22.04.2011   before   the   Commission  complaining against non­supply of information by the Respondents.
Decision
2. During the hearing, the Respondents stated that they, after examining the records related to the  Appellant's pension case and copies of certain orders provided by the Appellant to them, have come  to a conclusion that the Appellant's case is a genuine one and needs to be considered positively and  therefore  are    trying  to   calculate the same based on records that are available since an earlier  calculation that had been made in response to the RTI application was found to be incorrect. . 
3. In view of the Respondents' statement above, it is directed that the PIO shall provide to the Appellant  the factual position of his pension payment case by  30.09.2011.  It is also recommended that the  public authority take a decision on the Appellant's pension payment case preferably  by the same  date.
4. Appeal is disposed of with the above directions.
