2 18.11.2010 None for the petitioner. Learned counsel for the State and Bihar State Construction Corporation are present.
The reason why the petitioner is not entitled to claim seniority in the State Government since he was initially an appointee under the Corporation. The seniority will be reckoned when he joined the State government and not the Corporation.
Be that as it may, this writ application is dismissed for non-prosecution.
