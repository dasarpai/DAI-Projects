ORAL
JUDGMENT
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE JAYANT PATEL) The petitioners, by this petition, have prayed for appropriate directions to the respondents to hold the election of ordinary members to the Senate of the South Gujarat University and more particularly from the constituencies of Registered Graduates and Teachers and a further prayer is made to direct the respondents not to constitute the authorities under Section 15 of the South Gujarat University Act, 1965, excluding the consideration of the representation of the senate members from the constituencies of Registered Members.
Ms.Harshal Pandya for Mr.Upadhyay states that she has not received any instruction from her clients as to whether the petition survives or not.
It appears from the record of the special civil application that the General Body was to be constituted for a period of five years. The petition came to be filed in the year 2002 and by afflux of time, pending the petition, the said period of five years is over.
Under these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served in examining the questions, which are raised in the petition for academic purpose, as the petition has become infructuous by afflux of time.
Hence, the petition is disposed of as having become infructuous. Rule discharged. No order as to costs.
