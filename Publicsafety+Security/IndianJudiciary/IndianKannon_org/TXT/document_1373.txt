ORAL
ORDER
Mr AD Oza, learned advocate for the respondents seeks permission to withdraw the communication dated 19th July 2007, copy whereof has been endorsed to the petitioner on which the petitioner has based his petition. In view of the said withdrawal, the petition now does not survive. However, it is clarified that the withdrawal of the communication does not affect the Resolution of the Board of Directors taken in the 126th meeting dated 5th March 2007. It is also clarified that if, in future, the respondents intend to take any action of debarring the petitioner from awarding any work of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited, it will precede with the show-cause notice calling upon the petitioner to defend his interest. This petition is accordingly disposed of.
