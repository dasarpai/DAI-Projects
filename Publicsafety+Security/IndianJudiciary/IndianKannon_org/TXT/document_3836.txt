              "It is correct to say that all the teachers of the
        Department complained against me that they could not
        work with me. Rather, only few teachers made such
        proposal. (Further said ) that they were not satisfied with
        my work as Head. It is wrong to say that due to
        misconduct, I was expelled from the            University and
        without receiving that order, I resigned and returned to
        Allahabad." (E.T.C.)
1356.         For our purposes, however, suffice it to mention that
PW 15 has make out a new case and says that according to his
study there is grievous doubt whether Babar built the mosque in
dispute. He says that neither there is any material to show that
Babar ever visited Ayodhya nor the name "Mir Baqi" finds
mention in Baburnama. On page 217 he admits that as a result
of his research he has written on page 89 of his book that
inscriptions might have been fixed on the disputed building later
on mentioning that the disputed building was built by Babar and
on page 295 he refers to page 91 of his book where he has said
that the disputed building might have been constructed at the
time of Tughlaqs or Sharkis and may not have been built by
Babar. On page 300 he further says that if constructed by Sharki
Rulers, the disputed building might have been constructed prior
to 1504. He also says that averments in para 2 and 8 of the plaint
(Suit-4) that graves around the disputed building were of those
muslims who died in battle between Babar and the erstwhile
ruler of Ayodhya are incorrect statements (page 300). The
witness, therefore, has not supported the case of plaintiff (Suit-
                                                               1511

4) and on the contrary has taken a totally different stand. In fact
by reaching such inference, he has stated in his examination-in-
chief that the disputed building was not constructed after
demolishing a temple by Babar.
1357.       Here one more aspect we need to mention. Though
the witness has been produced as Expert Historian but on page
222 he admits that he had a very little knowledge of history.
That being so according to own statement of the witness his
statement cannot be taken as an opinion of an Expert Historian
and, therefore, inadmissible under Section 45 of the Evidence
Act. Even otherwise, the extract of his statement we have
noticed above make it clear that neither the witness has made
any threadbare inquiry into the matter nor has done his job
honestly yet has written a book based on hearse and has claimed
it to be a book written by an Expert. He admits that he cannot
read Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit and Urdu (Page 33). He admits
that despite being historian he has accepted whatever said by
others on the basis of their alleged scholarly feeling and wrote it
in his book as a statement of fact (page 38). He has never
studied either Calligraphy or Epigraphy (Page 51) but has made
statement and recorded finding in this regard in his book. On
page 65 he admits that he has raised doubt on the Calligraphy
style of the text of the inscription at Babri mosque but
simultaneously admits that he had not the least knowledge of art
and science of Calligraphy. We in fact find it surprising with the
kind of dishonesty, such person has shown. In his book he has
given in the footnote reference of a number of books which he
admits that he had never studied (page 68). On page 77 he says
that he did not pay attention on the fact whether the inscriptions
were installed from the beginning or installed subsequently but
                                                             1512

on page 217 admits that he has written on page 89 of his book
that there is a possibility that the inscriptions might have been
installed subsequently. On page 106 on the one hand he admits
that    he   lacks   knowledge   of   Epigraphy,    Numismatic,
Archeology, Survey of Land, Science of Architecture, Turkish,
Arabic and Persian language yet simultaneously he says that
though the period of construction of the disputed structure, he
could not conclude but according to him it relates prior to
Mughal period. We are sorry to find that a person like PW 15
has written a book on such an important and sensitive matter
without having made an in-depth study on the subject and has
deposed before us claiming himself to be an Expert Historian
though simultaneously admit that he has a very little knowledge
of history. On page 218 and 219 again contradicting his earlier
statement he said that he has made research on the question as to
how much old and of which period the inscriptions are and
found that the inner inscription appears to be new from the style
of calligraphy while the outer one is old. Despite admitting the
fact that he has no knowledge of calligraphy he has made such
comments on calligraphy of the text of inscription which is not
expected from a responsible Expert Historian. Besides his
statement ex facie appears to be incorrect in view of the
admitted position as also mentioned in Epigraphica Indica
(1965) published by ASI that there were three inscriptions out of
which two got misplaced in 1934 and were restored by new one
which had some mistakes and did not contain the correct
original text.
1358.        The lack of expertise of PW 15 in respect to
Medieval History has also been commented by plaintiff's (Suit-
4)'s another witness, i.e., PW 20, Shirin Musvi on page 129 of
                                                                             1513

1360.         The statement of PW 16 in respect to period of
construction and the person by whom, is solely based on two
inscriptions which he claims to have affixed on the disputed
building in Persian language though neither the witness can read
Persian nor could see the inner one. Here also on page 157 read
with 334 and 335 though the witness claims that the inscriptions
which were installed when he visited the premises were the
same as were installed at the time of construction of the building
and this shows that he has not read the text of the inscriptions as
published in different books from time to time and had no
occasion to compare the same but the statement has been made
on pure conjecture and surmises.
1361.         The expertise of PW 16 on the matter relating to
Medieval History has been doubted by another witness of
plaintiff (Suit-4), i.e., PW 20, Shirin Musvi in her statement on
page 129.
1362.         Further the witness do not claim to be an Expert
Historian but he is an Expert Archaeologist. Since he has written
an Article on the disputed building i.e. Paper No. 110C1/8
(Exhibit D37, Suit-5), it appears that to support its contents, he
came in witness box in his first appearance. For our purposes
suffice it to mention that here also the sole foundation for
claiming the period of construction of the building as "1528
AD" by Mir Baqi, the entire stress is on the said inscriptions and
nothing else.

is making as a historian but simultaneously on page 105 she said
that she has not read anything about Babari mosque and did not

mosque came into existence. On page 121, she also admits of

               "There was an inscription at Babari Masjid
        divided in three parts and its some part were printed in
        Beveridge's Babar-Nama. The entire inscription is
        published in 1965, Epigraphia Indica published by A.S.I. It
        is in Persian language and Nask-script. It mentions that
        Mir Baqi got the mosque constructed in 1528-29 AD on the
        orders and intention of Babar. The date of his construction
        is found from its script by numerical calculation. (page2-3)

        about the same in his accounts. He has said that it is

       "It is wrong to say that the inscriptions which stood
at the disputed structure were installed after the 1934 riot.
However, it is true that they were installed from before, as
Buchanan has mentioned in his account of 1810 AD. In all,
there are three inscriptions on the disputed structure. They
had different wordings but their meaning was almost same.
That is to say, the three inscriptions were installed at one
and the same time. They all belong to pre-1580 period. As
per the study of epigraphics, the script of all the three
inscriptions preceded 1580. I have read in Epigraphia
Indica Vol 1964-65 that the inscriptions was installed in
1528 itself. Epigraphia Indica is a Journal from the

        According to me, founder means the person who got it
        built." (E.T.C.)
1366.         PW 20 in her examination-in-chief, besides other,
has said that the inscription fixed at Babari mosque is divided in
three, and some part thereof was published in "Baburnama" by
Mrs. Beveridge and the entire inscription is in Epigraphica
Indica (1965) and this shows that the building in dispute was
constructed by Mir Baqi in 1528-29 AD. It is in Persian and
script is Nask. The inscription also shows that the construction
was made under the orders and as per the intention of Babar.
The first of her statement that there was one inscription divided
in three itself is not supported with what is pleaded and sought
to be proved by plaintiffs (Suit 4). Further the text of the
inscriptions as quoted in Baburnama by Beveridge and in
Epigraphica Indica (1965) differs. On page 121 of her
statement she claims to have seen the photo of original
inscription in Epigraphica Indica (1964-65) while the author has
said something else which we shall be discussing a bit later. On
page 29 she claims that Mir Baqi was appointed commander of
Awadh by Babar and on page 130 she says that Baqi Tashkandi
was another name of Mir Baqi and this name has been used by
Babar in Baburnama but we do not find mention of Mir Baqi or
the fact that Baqi Tashkandi was also called as Mir Baqi in the
Baburnama though some of the writers on their own have tried
to identify "Baqi Tashkandi" with Mir Baqi but without giving
                                                                      1525

any material to justify such inference. She further said that
Buchanan in his account in 1810 has mentioned about three
inscriptions (page 136-137) but we do not find any such
publication or book written by Buchanan mentioning the same.
On the contrary we find that Dr. Francis Buchanan though made
certain survey for about seven years starting from 1807 but
could not get himself published any material in this regard and
later on his material was processed and a report was published
in 1838 by "Robert Montgomery Martin".
1367.         In any case despite so many reasons some of which
we have already discussed, we find that the statement of the
above mentioned Expert witnesses suffer serious flaws and
make it extremely delicate situation for this Court to rely on
their opinion. The only thing which consistently emerges is that
the statement about the period of the construction and the person
who got the disputed building constructed is solely founded
upon the text of the inscriptions fixed on the disputed building.
There is no other material either to corroborate or to support it.
1368.         Besides above expert historians, some other
witnesses have also deposed about construction of mosque, the
period and the persons who got it constructed.

       "By the time Babar went to Ayodhya, he had
defeated Rana Sanga. It is possible that when Babar went
towards Ayodhya, it fell under Oudh and its Governor may
have been appointed by Ibrahim Lodi. When Babar had
gone towards Ayodhya, he had not gone to Ayodhya and
instead had halted few kose (distance of two miles) away
from Ayodhya along the banks of Ghaghra river. I am able
to recollect a bit that after halting at that place, Babar had
sent few of his associates to Ayodhya due to which Sheikh
Baijeed, the Governor appointed by Ibrahim Lodi, fled
away from Ayodhya. This fleeing incident of Baijeed
occurred around 1527-1528 AD, which is equivalent to 930
Hizri era. There is no doubt that details of incidents
occurring many months after this incident, are not
available in the Babarnama. After 28th March, 1528, the
next detail contained in Babarnama is of 2nd April, 1528. It
is possible that the next details commence from 18th
September, 1528. . . . . . . . . On 25-26th September, 1528
Babar had been to Urva valley in Gwalior and before
reaching Urva valley, he had passed through many cities.
It is possible that he may have passed through Agra. (The
witness) stated on his own that information in this behalf
can be had from Babarnama." (E.T.C.)

        from where he returned and went to Ayodhya, which is
        mentioned in second and third line of the said paragraph.
        To the best of my memory, this incident is subsequent to
        September, 1528. On the other occasion as well when
        Babar went towards Ayodhya, he did not enter Ayodhya
        and halted at a distance of 10 kose from Ayodhya. (The

Question:- Is this a copy of that very 'Epigraphia Indica'
you have referred to above ?
Answer:-      Yes,    Sir.   Photographs        of   the    aforesaid
inscriptions are published on this very paper no. 198 C -
2/95. The text and translation of the first inscription is
published on paper no. 198 C-2/96. Paper no. 198 C-2/97
carries the text and translation of the second inscription
and paper nos. 198 C - 2/97 & 198 C - 1/98 carry the text
and translation of the third inscription. These inscriptions
date back to the reign of Babur. These inscriptions have
935th year of the Hizri calendar written on them which
comes to be 1528 - 29 AD. That is why I have the
impression that these inscriptions were written in 1528."

       "Babar himself did not go to Ayodhya and instead
Baqi Shagaval (Mir Baqi), along with other commanders,
completed this task i.e. occupied Ayodhya and established
the administration and thereafter Babar proceeded towards
Gwalior after handing over charge of Awadh to Mir Baqi.
No reference is found about Babar's re-visit to Ayodhya.
The incident of construction of Babri mosque is subsequent

famous British surveyor Montgomery Martin, who wrote

discern undoubtedly that everybody's impression and opinion
about the period of construction is based on inscriptions and
nothing else. Therefore, scrutiny and study on inscription
become vital.
1388.       The written material which throws some light on this
aspect consists of Gazetteers (published from time to time);
                                                                 1552

settlement and survey reports; History books and certain other
books pertaining to the disputed site/building though strictly
speaking not written by well known historians but those persons
claim to have collected information on the basis of their own
inquiry or investigation etc. or had acquired knowledge in the
capacity in which they were working or otherwise or due to the
interest   generated   in   the   matter    after   dispute   spread
countrywide. We would place on record what has been said in
such published material and also consider their credibility etc.
simultaneously.
Gazetteers-Settlement/Survey Reports:
1389.       'Gazetteers', mostly published in 19th and 20th
century during the pre-independence period, and, one after
independence, published under the auspices of U.P. Government
and another by the Government of India are the documents
heavily relied in these cases. It is not in dispute that 'Gazetteers'
are not the documents published under some statutory provision.
In order to understand their evidenciary value and authority we
have to first consider what 'Gazetteer' means.
1390.       Learned counsels have placed before us a printout
taken from internet from the site "Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia" under the heading "Gazetteer". It says that a
'gazetteer' is a geographical dictionary or directory, an important
reference for information about places and place names, used in
conjunction with a map or a full Atlas. It geographically
contains information concerning the geographical makeup of a
country, regions or continent as well as the social statistics and
physical features such as mountains, waterways, or roads.
Examples of information provided by gazetteers include the
location of places, dimensions of physical features, population,
                                                             1553

literacy rate, etc. The "Oxford Dictionary" defines the
"gazetteer" as a geographical index or dictionary. It refers to a
document published by British Historian "Laurence Echard" in
1693 bears the title "Gazetteer's or Newman's Interpreter: Being
a Geographical Index". Echard wrote that the title "gazetteers"
was suggested to him by a very eminent person whose name
was not disclosed. The next part was published by Echard in
1704 as "the Gazetteer simply". This is considered to be the
introduction by the word gazetteer into the English language. It
is said that since 18th century the word gazetteer has been used
interchangeably to define either its traditional maning (i.e., a
geographical dictionary or directory) or a daily news paper such
as London Gazetteer. Tracing the history of gazetteer
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia says:
           "Gazetteers of ancient Greece existed since the
     Hellenistic era. The first known gazetteer of China
     appeared by the 1st century, and with the age of print
     media in China by the 9th century, the Chinese gentry
     became invested in producing gazetteers for their local
     areas as a source of information as well as local pride.
     Although existent only in fragments, the geographer
     Stephanus of Byzantium wrote a geographical dictionary in
     the 6th century which influenced later European compilers
     of gazetteers by the 16th century. Modern gazetteers can be
     found in reference sections of most libraries as well as on
     the Web.
           In his journal article "Alexander and the Ganges"
     (1923), the 20th century historian W.W. Tarn calls a list
     and description of satrapies of Alexander's Empire written
     between 324 and 323 BC as an ancient gazetteer. Tarn
                                                       1554

notes that the document is dated no later than June 323
BC, since it features Babylon as not yet partitioned by
Alexander's generals. It was revised by the Greek historian
Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC. In the 1st century
BC, Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentioned the chronicle-
type format of the writing of the logographers in the age
before the founder of the Greek historiographic tradition,
Herodotus (i.e. before the 480s BC), saying "they did not
write connected accounts but instead broke them up
according to peoples and cities, treating each separately."
Historian Truesdell S. Brown asserts that what Dionysius'
describes in this quote about the logographers should be
categorized not as a true "history" but rather as a
gazetteer. While discussing the Greek conception of the
river delta in ancient Greek literature, Francis Celoria
notes that both Ptolemy and Pausanias of the 2nd century
AD provided gazetteer information on geographical terms.
      Perhaps predating Greek gazetteers were those made
in ancient Egypt. Although she does not specifically label
the document as a gazetteer, Penelope Wilson (PhD,
Lecturer in the Department of Archaeology at Durham
University) describes an ancient Egyptian papyrus found at
the site of Tanis, Egypt (a city founded during the
Twentieth dynasty of Egypt) which provides the following
for each administrative area of Egypt at the time.
      The Domesday Book initiated by William I of
England in 1086 was a government survey on all the
administrative counties of England; it was used to assess
the properties of farmsteads and landholders in order to
tax them sufficiently. In the survey, numerous English
                                                         1555

castles were listed; scholars debate on exactly how many
were actually referenced in the book. However, the
Domesday Book does detail the fact that out of 3,558
registered houses destroyed in 112 different boroughs
listed, 410 of these destroyed houses were the direct result
of castle construction and expansion. In 1316, the Nomina
Villarum survey was initiated by Edward II of England; it
was essentially a list of all the administrative subdivisions
throughout England which could be utilized by the state in
order to assess how much military troops could be
conscripted and summoned from each region. The
Speculum Britanniae (1596) of the Tudor era English
cartographer and topographer John Norden (1548-1625)
had an alphabetical list of places throughout England with
headings showing their administrative hundreds and
referenced to attached maps. Englishman John Speed's
Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine published in 1611
provided gazetteers for counties throughout England,
which included illustrative maps, short local histories, a
list of administrative hundreds, an index of parishes, and
the coordinates of longitude and latitude for county towns.
Starting in 1662, the Hearth Tax Returns with attached
maps of local areas were compiled by individual parishes
throughout England while a duplicate of their records were
sent to the central government offices of the Exchequer. To
supplement his 'new large Map of England' from 1677, the
English cartographer John Adams compiled the extensive
gazetteer "Index Villaris" in 1680 that had some 24,000
places listed with geographical coordinates coinciding with
the map. The "Geographical Dictionary" of Edmund Bohun
                                                      1556

was published in London in 1688, comprising 806 pages
with some 8,500 entries. In his work, Edmund Bohun
attributed the first known Western geographical dictionary
to geographer Stephanus of Byzantium (fl. 6th century)
while also noting influence in his work from the Thesaurus
Geographicus (1587) by the Belgian cartographer
Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598), but stated that Ortelius'
work dealt largely with ancient geography and not up-to-
date    information.   Only   fragments   of    Stephanus'
geographical work Ethnica (Εθνικά) have survived and
were first examined by the Italian printer Aldus Manutius
in his work of 1502.
       The Italian monk Phillippus Ferrarrius (d. 1626)
published    his   geographical    dictionary    "Epitome
Geographicus in Quattuor Libros Divisum" in the Swiss
city of Zurich in 1605. He divided this work into overhead
topics of cities, rivers, mountains, and lakes and swamps.
All placenames, given in Latin, were arranged in
alphabetical order for each overhead division by
geographic type;. A year after his death, his "Lexicon
Geographicum" was published, which contained more than
9,000 different entries for geographic places. This was an
improvement over Ortelius' work, since it included modern
placenames and places discovered since the time of
Ortelius.
       Pierre Duval (1618-1683), a nephew of the French
cartographer Nicolas Sanson, wrote various geographical
dictionaries. These include a dictionary on the abbeys of
France, a dictionary on ancient sites of the Assyrians,
Persians, Greeks, and Romans with their modern
                                                          1557

equivalent names, and a work published in Paris in 1651
that was both the first universal and vernacular
geographical dictionary of Europe. With the gradual
expansion of Laurence Echard's (d. 1730) gazetteer of
1693, it too became a universal geographical dictionary
that was translated into Spanish in 1750, into French in
1809, and into Italian in 1810.
      Following the American Revolutionary War, United
States clergyman and historian Jeremy Belknap and
Postmaster General Ebenezer Hazard intended to create
the first post-revolutionary geographical works and
gazetteers, but they were anticipated by the clergyman and
geographer Jedidiah Morse with his Geography Made
Easy in 1784. However, Morse was unable to finish the
gazetteer in time for his 1784 geography and postponed it.
Yet his delay to publish it lasted too long, as it was Joseph
Scott in 1795 who published the first post-revolutionary
American gazetteer, his Gazetteer of the United States.
With the aid of Noah Webster and Rev. Samuel Austin,
Morse finally published his gazetteer The American
Universal Geography in 1797. However, Morse's gazetteer
did not receive distinction by literary critics, as gazetteers
were deemed as belonging to a lower literary class. The
reviewer of Joseph Scott's 1795 gazetteer commented that
it was "little more than medleys of politics, history and
miscellaneous remarks on the manners, languages and arts
of different nations, arranged in the order in which the
territories stand on the map." Nevertheless, in 1802 Morse
followed up his original work by co-publishing A New
Gazetteer of the Eastern Continent with Rev. Elijah Parish,
                                                             1558

        the latter of whom Ralph H. Brown asserts did the "lion's
        share of the work in compiling it."
1391.      In 19th Century it is said that gazetteers were widely
popular in Britain with publishers such as Fullarton, Mackenzie,
Chambers and W & A.K. Johnston, many of whom were
Scottish, meeting public demand for information on an
expanding Empire.
1392.     The above discussion gives us an idea and broad feature
of documents published and termed as "Gazetteer". There is
distinction between Gazette and Gazetteer. The British
Government enacted "Official Gazette Act, 1863" (Act No.
XXXI of 1863) and published various Gazettes thereunder. The
Gazetteer, as said about is not founded on a statute but being a
document published under the authority or auspices of the
Government, deserve much more reliability and confidence. It
constitute an important source of historical and other
informations in general and most authenticated data about the
then existing affairs.
1393.         The extent to which informations contained in
Gazetters can be believed, relied and considered has been
subject matter of Courts time and again wherein the information
contained in the Gazetters has also been utilized in one or the
other manner. Some of such cases may be referred as under. It
appears that the consensus of the judicial opinion is that
information contained in a Gazetteer can be considered but
carrectness thereof may need corrorroboration. It all depend on
the nature of dispute in every case.
1394.         In Fulbati Kumari Vs. Maheshwari Prasad Singh
AIR 1923 Patna 453 a Division Bench of Patna High Court
relied upon the Bengal District Gazetteer, Volume XVII in order
                                                                  1559

to gather some information about what happened at Dumri when
Captain Brown took over charge of the operations in the jungle
terry tracts in 1774.
1395.          In Sukhdev Singh Vs. Maharaja Bahadur of
Gidhaur AIR 1951 SC 288 Bengal District Gazetteer, Vol.
XVII was referred and in para 10 the Apex Court held:
         "The statement in the District Gazetteer is not necessarily
         conclusive, but the Gazetteer is an official document of
         some value, as it is compiled by experienced officials with
         great care after obtaining the facts from official records."
1396.          In Gopal Krishnaji Ketkar Vs. Mahomed Jaffar
Hussein AIR 1954 SC 5 a dispute regarding management of a
Darga known as Haji Malang came to be considered before the
Apex Court. The Darga had two tomb, one of a Hindu and
another of Muslim saint. The Court referred to the Gazetteer of
Bombay to find out the history which is said to have lost an
antiquity and from the gazetteer it appears that a Muslim saint
came to India as an Urban missionary in 13th century and after
his death, he was buried in the said Darga. There was another
tomb called Mayi's tomb where the body of a Hindu Raja's
daughter treated by Bawa Malang as his daughter was buried. In
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Apex Court
observed that such matter cannot be governed either by Hindu
or Muslim law but should be governed by its own special
customs or by general law of public religious and charitable
trust.
1397.          In Chhote Khan & others Vs. Mal Khan & others
AIR 1954 SC 575, the Court referred to Gazetteer Gurgaon
District (1910) with respect to the properties owned by Meos of
Ferozepore Tehsil and others villages in Gurgaon. It also
                                                                 1560

referres to the settlement record of 1877 observing that it is an
important document.
1398.         In Biswambhar Singh & others Vs. State of Orissa
& another AIR 1954 SC 139, the Court referred to Hunter's
Imperial Gazetter, Volume 4, page 478 which mentions certain
facts about the origin of Bhuyans as also the Settlement Report
of 1907-1911.
1399.         In   Commissioner      of    Income-tax     Vs.    Sri
Ramakrishna Deo AIR 1959 SC 239, the Court referred to the
District Gazetteer, Vishakhapatnam, 1907 in para 3 of its
judgment.
1400.         In State of Bihar & others Vs. Bhabapritananda
Ojha AIR 1959 SC 1073, the Court referred to Bihar District
Gazetteer relating to Santal Parganas, 1938.
1401.         In Swami Motor Transports (P) Ltd. & Anr. Vs.
Sri Sankaraswamigal Mutt & Anr. AIR 1963 SC 864 the
Court resorted to rely on "Madras District Gazetteers, Madurai"
in respect to certain statistical data published therein in support
of the claim of the State observing that this is the information
furnished from authorized Government publication.
1402.         In Mahant Shri Srinivasa Ramanuj Das Vs.
Surayan Dass & Anr. AIR 1967 SC 256 the Court said:
        "These statements in the Gazetteer are not relied on as
        evidence of title but as providing historical material and
        the practice followed by the Math and its head. The
        Gazetteer can be consulted on matters of public history."
1403.         In   Laxman     Siddappa     Naik    vs.   Kattimani
Chandappa Jampanna and others AIR 1968 SC 929 the Apex
Court approved the consultation of Bombay Karnatak Gazetteer
of 1893 and certain other similar documents to find out the
                                                                 1561

distinguishing customs and manners of different tribes.
1404.         Sri R.L.Verma, however, submits that in a suit
where the question of title of temple or property is involved, it
cannot be said to be a question of history and therefore, neither
the Gazetteers nor the report of Archaeological Survey etc. can
be an appropriate book of reference for deciding such a
controversy and placed reliance on Farzand Ali Vs. Zafar Ali
46 IC 119 where it is observed:
              "We are inclined to think that the use of the
        historical works to establish title to the property cannot be
        justified on the strength of Section 57 of the Indian
        Evidence Act. The question of title between the trustee of a
        mosque, though an old and historical institution, and a
        private person, cannot, in our opinion, be deemed to be a
        'matter of public history' within the meaning of the said
        section."
1405.         The submission, in our view, is totally misconceived
and travels much beyond the point for which the various copies
of gazetteers have been filed before us by the parties and in fact
some observations therefrom are also relied by Sri Verma. For
the purpose of historical events and fact as they were centuries
ago, the manner in which they have taken are detailed in the
documents published under the authority of the then
Government in the form of Gazetteers.

1407.         The first gazetteer in respect to Indian sub-continent
came to be published in 1828 under the title "East India
                                                                1562

Gazetteer" by Walter Hamilton (second edition reprint 1993
by Low Price Publications, Delhi) containing particulars and
descriptions    of   the   Empires,    Kingdoms,     Principalities,
Provinces, Cities, Towns, Districts, Fortresses, harbours, rivers,
lakes and, C. of Hindostan and the adjacent Countries, India
beyond the Ganges and the eastern Archipelago.
1408.        Hamilton's "Gazetter" of 1828 on page 353 under
the heading 'Oude' gives following information about Ayodhya :
        "Pilgrims resort to this vicinity, where the remains of the
        ancient city of Oude, and capital of the great Rama, are
        still to be seen; but whatever may have been its former
        magnificence it now exhibits nothing but a shapeless mass
        of ruins. The modern town extends a considerable way
        along the banks of the Goggra, adjoining Fyzabad, and is
        tolerably well peopled; but inland it is a mass of rubbish
        and jungle, among which are the reputed site of temples
        dedicated to Rama, Seeta, his wife, Lakshman, his
        general, and Hanimaun (a large monkey), his prime
        minister. The religious mendicants who perform the
        pilgrimage to Oude are chiefly of the Ramata sect, who
        walk round the temples and idols, bathe in the holy pools,
        and perform the customary ceremonies."
1409.       Thereafter Robert Montgomery Martin, for the first
time sought to contradict local belief or tradition about the
person who made construction by referring to an inscription on
the wall of the disputed building according to which it was the
work of the conqueror Babar falsifying the local tradition of its
construction by Aurangzabe in his work "The History,
Antiquities, Topography and Statistics of Eastern India"
(1838 AD) (Ex. 20, Suit 5-Paper No.107C1/109-110). The copy
                                                                   1563

of the book in all 6 volumes available to the Court is the first
Indian reprint 1976 by Cosmo Publications, Delhi. The details
of inscription referred to in the above passage have not been
given. It says at page 334/335, Vol.II, as under:
        ".... if these temples ever existed, not the smallest trace of
        them remains to enable us to judge of the period when they
        were built; and the destruction is very generally attributed
        by the Hindus to the furious zeal of Aurungzebe, to whom
        also is imputed the overthrow of the temples in Benares
        and Mathura. What may have been the case in the two
        latter, I shall not now take upon myself to say, but with
        respect to Ayodhya the tradition seems very ill founded.
        The bigot by whom the temples were destroyed, is said to
        have erected mosques on the situations of the most
        remarkable temples; but the mosque at Ayodhya, which is
        by far the most entire, and which has every appearance of
        being the most modern, is ascertained by an inscription on
        its walls (of which a copy is given) to have been built by
        Babur, five generations before Aurungzebe."
1410.         Edward     Thornton    in   "A    Gazetteer    of    the
Territories under the Government of the East-India
Company and of the native States on the Continent of India",
first published in 1858 (reproduced in 1993) by Low Price
Publications, Delhi (Book No. 10) on page 739 (Paper
No.107C1-10 i.e. Ex.5 Suit 5) under the heading "Oudh"
observed as under:
              "According to native tradition, they were demolished
        by Aurungzebe, who built a mosque on part of the site. The
        falsehood of the tradition is, however, proved by an
        inscription on the wall of the mosque, attributing the work
                                                                 1564

        to the conqueror Baber, from whom Aurungzabe was fifth
        in descent. The mosque is embellished with fourteen
        columns of only five or six feet in height, but of very
        elaborate and tasteful workmanship, said to have been
        taken from the ruins of the Hindoo fanes . . . . ." (emphasis
        added)
1411.         We do not find from the above Gazetteer whether
Thornton himself had viewed the alleged inscription, whether
there was only one inscription or more than one and whether
Thornton was capable of himself reading Persian/Arabic or the
said information is based on secondary evidence, i.e.,
information he might have received from somebody else whose
authenticity is also not known. To us it appear that the above
observations are founded on what has been noticed by Robert
Montgomery Martin in "The History, Antiquities, Topography
and Statistics of Eastern India" by Robort Montgomry
Martin (Vol-II) (first published in 1838 AD) (Supra) (Ex. 20,
Suit-5-Paper No. 107 C1/109-110) where referring to the survey
made by the Dr. Buchanan, Martin referred the inscription and
contradicted local belief and tradition of demolition by
Aurangzeb and said that it must have been the work of Babar.
1412.         However, from the words "an inscription", to us it
appears that according to his information there existed only one
inscription on the wall of the mosque which attributed the work
to Emperor Babar.
1413.         Then comes P. Carnegy's "A Historical Sketch of
Tahsil Fyzabad, Zillah Fyzabad" (hereinafter referred to as
"P. Carnegy's Historical Sketch"). He was an Officiating
Commissioner and Settlement Officer at Faizabad and in 1967
prepared the said report which was published in 1870. Copies
                                                               1565

of frontispiece, pages 5, 6, 7, 19, 20 and 21 have been filed as
paper No.107C1/17-23 i.e. Ex.49, Suit 5 (Register 20, page 35-
47). Appendix-A containing the list of sacred places in and
about Ajudhia has been filed as Ex. A-10 (Suit4) (Register 16,
pages 67 to 78). With respect to construction of the disputed
building, on page 20 and 21 of the book, (Paper No.107C1/22-
23), P. Carnegy has said:
           "The Janamasthan and other temples.- It is locally
     affirmed that at the Mahomedan conquest there were three
     important Hindu shrines, with but few devotees attached, at
     Ajudhia, which was then little other than wilderness. These
     were the "Janamasthan," the "Sargadwar mandir" also
     known as "Ram Darbar" and the "Tareta-ke-Thakur."
           On the first of these the Emperor Babar built the
     mosque which still bears his name, A.D. 1528. On the
     second Aurangzeb did the same A.D. 1658-1707; and on
     the third that sovereign, or his predecessor, built a mosque,
     according to the well known Mahomedan principle of
     enforcing their religion on all those whom they conquered.
           Babar's mosque.- According to Leyden's memoirs of
     Babar that Emperor encamped at the junction of the Serwa
     and Gogra rivers two or three kos east from Ajudhia, on
     the 28th March1528, and there he halted 7 or 8 days setting
     the surrounding country. A well known hunting ground is
     spoken of in that work, 7 or 8 kos above Oudh, on the
     banks of the Surju. It is remarkable that in all the copies of
     Babar's life now known, the pages that relate to his doings
     at Ajudhia are wanting. In two places in the Babari mosque
     the year in which it was built 935 H. corresponding with
     1528 A.D. is carved in stone, along with inscriptions
                                                                1566

        dedicated to the glory of that Emperor.
1414.         The reference of inscriptions in Carnegy's Historical
Sketch is also at page 27, Section VI under the heading
"Buildings" at Serial Item 5 which states as under:
        "Babar's mosque with stone inscriptions in Ajudhia, date
        A.D. 1528, and stone columns of infinitely greater
        antiquity."
1415.         Here Carnegy has referred two inscriptions on the
disputed building to infer that the same was constructed in 935
Hizra (corresponding with 1528 AD). He has also not said
anything further. He also gave no details or the text of the
alleged inscriptions.
1416.         In "Gazetteer of Oudh" by Mr. W.C. Benett, C.S.,
Assistant Commissioner (1877) (Book No. 11), the factum of
the construction of disputed building is given on page 6/7 which
is a virtual reproduction of what is said in P. Carnegy's
Historical Sketch (supra) as evident from the following:
              "The Janamasthan and other temples.--It is locally
        affirmed that at the Muhammadan conquest there were
        three important Hindu shrines, with but few devotees
        attached, at Ajodhya, which was then little other than a
        wilderness.   These   were    the   "Janamasthan,"      the
        "Swargaddwar mandir" also known as "Ram Darbar,"
        "Treta-ke-Thakur."
              On the first of these the Emperor Babar built the
        mosque, which still bears his name, A.D. 1528. On the
        second, Aurangzeb did the same, A.D. 1658 to 1707; and
        on the third, that sovereign or his predecessors built a
        mosque, according to the well-known Muhammadan
        principle of enforcing their religion on all those whom they
                                                                 1567

        conquered.
              Babar's mosque.--According to Leyden's Memoirs of
        Babar, that Emperor encamped at the junction of the Serwa
        and Gogra rivers two or three kos east from Ajodhya, on
        the 28th March 1528, and there he halted seven or eight
        days, settling the surrounding country. A well-known
        hunting ground is spoken of in that work, seven or eight kos
        above Oudh, on the banks of the Sarju. It is remarkable
        that in all the copies of Babar's life now known, the
        pages that relate to his doings at Ajodhya are wanting.
        In two places in the Babari Mosque, the year in which it
        was built, 935 H., corresponding with 1528 A.D., is
        carved in stone, along with inscriptions dedicated to the
        glory of that Emperor.
              If Ajodhya was then little other than a wilderness, it
        must at least have possessed a fine temple in the
        Janamasthan; for many of its columns are still in
        existence and in good preservation, having been used by
        the Musalmans in the construction of the Babari
        Mosque. These are of strong, close-grained, dark-colored
        or black stone, called by the natives kasauti (literally
        touch-stone slate,) and carved with different devices. To my
        thinking these more strongly resemble Buddhist pillars
        than those I have seen at Benares and elsewhere. They are
        from seven to eight feet long, square at the base, centre and
        capital, and round or octagonal intermediately." (emphasis
        added)
1417.     Next is the "Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh" Vol. I
(three volumes in one) published by Low Price Publications,
Delhi (first published in 1877-78) (reprinted in LPP 1993)
                                                                1568

(Book No. 11). Copy of pages No.6 and 7 of the aforesaid
Gazetteer have been filed as Papers No.107C1/25-26 i.e. Ex.7,
Suit-5 (Register 20, Page 51-53). The 'introduction' of the above
gazetteer has been written by Mr. W.C. Benett, C.S., Assistant
Commissioner. Therefore, to us it appears that the above
gazetteer was prepared by or under the supervision of Mr.
Benett who might have been assisted with a number of other
offers contributing write ups on different items. On page
XXXIX, chapter I, "Introduction", it says:
              "The great Afghan captains whom that prince
        defeated in Oudh have left no representatives, and the four
        pages describing the events which attended his entry to
        Ajodhya, where it is possible that the Hindu chiefs rallied
        round the centre of their religion, are missing from all the
        known copies of his memoirs. The only record remaining
        is an ancient mosque, which preserves the invader's
        name on the holiest spot of all--the birthplace of
        Rama."
1418.         Thereafter on page 6/7, under the headings "The
Janamasthan and other temples" and "Babar's mosque" it
mentions about the inscriptions at two places in the disputed
building to show the period of construction and the person by
whom it was constructed. It is again a repetition of what was
said in P. Carnegy's Historical Sketch (supra) and there is no
substantial difference therein:
              "The Janamasthan and other temples--It is locally
        affirmed that at the Muhammadan conquest there were
        three important Hindu shrines, with but few devotees
        attached, at Ajodhya, which was then little other than a
        wilderness.   These    were    the   "Janamasthan"      the
                                                                1569

        "Swargaddwar mandir" also known as "Ram Darbar,"
        "Treta-ke-Thakur".
              On the first of these the Emperor Babar built the
        mosque, which still bears his name, A.D. 1528. On the
        second, Aurangzed did the same, A.D. 1658 to 1707; and
        on the third, that sovereign or his predecessors built a
        mosque, according to the well-known Muhammadan
        principle of enforcing their religion on all those whom they
        conquered."
              Babar's mosque--According to Leyden's Memoirs of
        Babar, that Emperor encamped at the junction of the Serwa
        and Gogra rivers two or three kos east from Ajodhya on
        the 28th March 1528, and there he halted seven or eight
        days, settling the surrounding country. A well-known
        hunting ground is spoken of in that work, seven or eight kos
        above Oudh, on the banks of the Sarju. It is remarkable
        that in all the copies of Babar's life now known, the pages
        that relate to his doings at Ajodhya are wanting. In two
        places in the Babari Mosque, the year in which it was
        built, 935 H. corresponding with 1528 A.D. is carved in
        stone, along with inscriptions dedicated to the glory of
        that Emperor."
1419.      "Report on the settlement of the Land Revenue of the
Fyzabad District", (Book No. 18) by A.F. Millett, C.S.,
Officiating Settlement Officer, published by North Western
Provinces and Oudh Government press, Allahabad in 1880
(hereinafter referred to as "Millet's report, 1880"). The book on
the very first page mentions that it contains partly, reports and
notes of P. Carnegy, late Settlement Officer, and J. Woodborn,
late Officiating Settlement Officer. Copies of the frontispiece as
                                                                1570

well as page No.218, 231, 235 and 236 have been filed as Paper
No.107C1/27-30A i.e. Ex.8, Suit-5 (Register Vol.20 Pages 55-
62).
1420.      Here also reference of the disputed building, the period
of its construction by Emperor Babar is in the same language as
stated in P. Carnegy's Historical Sketch (supra) and there is no
substantial difference in the two except of some addition as is
evident from para 666 and 667, read as under:
              "666. The Janmasthan and other temples.- It is
        locally affirmed that at the Mahomedan conquest there
        were three important Hindu shrines, with but few devotees
        attached, at Ajudhya, which was then little other than a
        wilderness.   These    were    the    "Janmasthan,"     the
        "Sargadwar mandir," also known as "Ram Darbar," and
        "Tareta-Ke-Thakur." On the first of these the Emperor
        Baber built the mosque which still bears his name, A.D.
        1528; on the second Aurangzeb did the same, A.D. 1658-
        1707; and on the third that sovereign, or his predecessor,
        built a mosque according to the well-known Mahomedan
        principle of enforcing their religion on all those whom they
        conquered. The Janmasthan marks the place where
        Ramchandar was born. The Sargadwar is the gate
        through which he passed into Paradise, possibly the spot
        where his body was burned. The Tareta-Ke-Thakur was
        famous as the place where Rama performed a great
        sacrifice, and which he commemorated by setting up there
        images of himself and Sita.
              "667. Babar's mosque.- According to Leyden's
        Memoirs of Babar, that emperor encamped at the junction
        of the Serwu and Gogra rivers, two or three kos east from
                                                               1571

        Ajudhya, on the 28th March, 1528, and there he halted
        seven or eight days, settling the surrounding country. A
        well-known hunting-ground is spoken of in that work, seven
        or eight kos above Oudh, on the banks of the Sarju. It is
        remarkable that in all the copies of Babar's life now known
        the pages that relate to his doings at Ajudhya are wanting.
        In two places in the Babari mosque the year in which it
        was built, 935 H., corresponding with 1528 A.D., is
        carved in stone, along with inscriptions dedicated to the
        glory of that emperor."
1421.      Next comes "Barabanki: A gazetteer being Volume
XLVIII of the District Gazetteer of the United Provinces of
Agra and Oudh" compiled and edited by H.R. Nevill, I.C.S.,
printed by F. Luker, Supdt., Government Press, United
Provinces, Allahabad in 1904 (hereinafter referred to as
"Nevill's Barabanki Gazetteer 1904"). Copy of pages No.168-
169 have been filed as Paper No.107C1/40-41; Ex.52, Suit-5.
He does not refer to any inscription etc. but while describing
Hindu Muslim clash said to have occurred in 1853, he observed:
        "The cause of the occurrence was one of the numerous
        disputes that have sprung up from time to time between the
        Hindu priests and the Musalmans of Ajodhya with regard
        to the ground on which formerly stood the Janamasthan
        temple, which was destroyed by Babar and replaced by a
        mosque."
1422.       In "Fyzabad-a Gazetteer being Vol. XLIII of the
District Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and
Oudh" by H.R. Nevill published in 1905 (Book No. 4)
(hereinafter referred to as "Fyzabad Gazetteer, 1905"), page
173 refers to two inscriptions with the details of their place of
                                                              1572

installation:
                "Ajodhya is pre-eminently a city of temples, and
      apart from these there are but few points of interest in the
      place. Not all of these places of worship are connected with
      the Hindu religion. There are six Jain shrines which have
      been already mentioned in Chapter III in connection with
      Jainism in this district; and there are also the Musalman
      mosques and tombs. It is locally affirmed that at the time
      of the Musalman conquest there were three important
      Hindu shrines at Ajodhya and little else. These were the
      Janamasthan temple, the Swargaddwar, and the Treta-
      ka-Thakur, and each was successively made the object
      of attention of different Musalman rulers. The
      Janamsthan was in Ramkot and marked the birthplace
      of Rama. In 1528 A.D. Babar came to Ajodhya and
      halted here for a week. He destroyed the ancient temple
      and on its site built a mosque, still known as Babar'
      mosque. The materials of the old structure were largely
      employed, and many of the columns are in good
      preservation; they are of close grained black stone,
      called by the natives Kasauti, and carved with various
      devices. Their length is from seven to eight feet, and the
      shape square at the base, centre and capital, the rest being
      round or octagonal. The mosque has two inscriptions, one
      on the outside and the other on the pulpit; both are in
      Persian and bear the date 935 Hijri. Of the authenticity of
      the inscriptions there can be no doubt, but no record of the
      visit to Ajodhya is to be found in the Musalman historians.
      It must have occurred about the time of his expedition to
      Bihar." (emphasis added)
                                                                 1573

Ex.11, Suit-5; Register Vol.20 page 85-97.

1423.       Next is "Imperial Gazetteer of India--Provincial
Series--United Provinces of Agra and Oudh"-Vol. II (1908)
(Book No. 16) published by Superintendent of Government
Printing Calcutta, where at page 388-389 (Ex.10 Suit-5; Paper
No.107C1/37-39) it says:
              "At one corner of a vast mound known as Ramkot,
        or the fort of Rama, is the holy spot where the hero was
        born. Most of the enclosure is occupied by a mosque
        built by Babar from the remains of an old temple, and in
        the outer portion a small platform and shrine mark the
        birthplace. Close by is a larger temple in which is shown
        the cooking-place of Sita, the faithful wife of Rama. A lofty
        temple stands on the bank of the Gogra at the place where
        Lakshmana bathed; and Hanuman, king of the monkeys, is
        worshipped in a large temple in the town, approached by
        an immense flight of steps, which bears the name Hanuman
        Garhi. Other noticeable temples built during the eighteenth
        and nineteenth centuries are the Kanakbhawan, a fine
        building   erected   by   a   Rani    of   Tikamgarh,    the
        Nageshwarnath temple, Darshan Singh's temple, and a
        small marble temple built by the present Maharaja,
        Ajodhya also contains a number of Jain temples, five of
        which were built in the eighteenth century to mark the
        birthplaces of the five heirarchs who are said to have been
        born at Ajodhya. Besides the mosque of Babar, two
        ruined mosques, built by Aurangzeb, stand on the sites
        of celebrated Hindu shrines--the Swargadwara, where
                                                              1574

        Rama's body was cremated, and the Treta-ka-Thakur,
        where he sacrificed." (emphasis added)
1424.      The above gazetteer only refers the name of Emperor
Babar that he constructed disputed building but neither the
period nor the basis of such information is mentioned.
1425.        H.R. Nevill, I.C.S., published another gazetteer in
1928 under the title "Fyzabad: A Gazetteer being Vol. XLIII
of the District Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and
Oudh". Copy of the frontispiece and pages no.178, 179, 180
and 181 have been filed as Paper No.107C1/49-53 (Register 20,
pages 99-107). In the preface written by Nevill in February,
1905 he said that in the earlier gazetteer of the province of
Oudh, articles dealing with District Fyzabad and its various
other divisions, towns and villages were taken almost wholly
from the valuable and defuse Settlement Report of Mr. A.F.
Millett, which embodied a large proportion of the remarkable
notes and reports of Mr. Patrick Carnegy and the late Sri John
Woodburn. These contain much that is now obsolete and still
more of a purely traditional and speculative character. After
collecting fresh materiel he found the necessity of publication of
the said gazetteer. Chapter V deals with 'History'. For the
present purpose we are confining to that part of the Gazetteer
which deals with the period of construction of the disputed
structure. On pages 151-152 the facts about the first Muslim
invasion of Oudh is mentioned as under:
             "The first Musalman invasion of Oudh was,
        according to the popular tradition, that of Saiyid Salar
        Masaud. The Mirat-i-Masaudi states that the youthful
        invader went from Multan to Ajodhya, where, after taking
        the city without a struggle, he remained hunting for some
                                                                  1575

        time and then set out for Delhi in 1030 A.D. The route
        taken is remarkable and the story must be confused in some
        manner. There is no mention of his passing through
        Ajodhya on his march from Satrikh to Bahraich, where he
        met his death; but popular legend steps in to fill the gap."
1426.       The above narration is sought to be supported by
referring to the "History of India-As told by its own
Historians" by Sir H.M. Elliot and John Dowson, Vol. II, page
531. We have with us all the eight volumes of the book of Elliot
and Dowson which was first published in 1866-1877 and
reprinted in 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2008. In the appendix
Chapter III which starts from page 528 of Vol. II it appears that
Salar Masud son of Sultan Mahmud Subuktagin came to India
by crossing the river Indus. Having conquest Multan he led his
army against 'Ajudhan'. A few lines from page 530-531 of
Elliot and Dowson's book are as under:
              "The rainy season had now set in, so they remained
        at Multan the next four months. After the rains, Mas'ud led
        his army against Ajudhan. Although, in those days, that
        place and its vicinity was thickly peopled, it was subdued
        without a struggle. Mas'ud was delighted with the climate
        of Ajudhan, and as, moreover, it was a good sporting
        country, he remained there till the end of the following
        rains, when he set off for Delhi."
1427.     On page 530, footnote, the authors (Elliot and Dowson)
have said:
              "Ajudha or Ayodhya is the old form of the name
        Oudh. The scene of Mas'ud's later exploits is laid in the
        neighbourhood of Oudh."
1428.        This narration claims to be an English translation of
                                                                1576

"Mir-at-i-Masaudi" written by Abdu-r Rahman Chishti. On page
513 the editor of the book "History of India" has mentioned
about the author and the book "Mir-at-i-Masaudi" as well the
following facts in order to enhance the degree of reliability on
the aforesaid work in respect to life story of Salar Masaud:
            "This is professedly a life of Mas'ud the Ghaznivide,
      and finds an appropriate place here after the story books.
      The author of this extraordinary work was by name' Abdu-r
      Rahman Chirsti. He explains the motives which impelled
      him to its composition, and the sources of his information
      after the following manner: "The history of the King of
      Martyrs, Salar Mas'ud, the facts of his birth, of his coming
      to Hindustan, and of his martyrdom, are told by different
      men in various ways, which have not found a place in any
      historical work of repute. The writer had long endeavoured
      to ascertain the real facts; and, after much research he
      obtained possession of an old book written by Mulla
      Muhammad Ghaznawi. This man was servant of Sultan
      Mahmud Subuktigin. He was also in the service of Salar
      Sahu, and of the Prince of Martyrs, whom he survived. The
      writer perused this old book from beginning to end with the
      greatest pleasure, and the doubts which he had entertained
      were dispelled. The book was very long, it entered into
      details about the wars of Sultan Mahmud, and Salar Sahu,
      mentioning incidentally here and there the King of
      Martyrs, and closing with an account of his martyrdom.
      Several of the beloved friends and attendants of the Martyr
      Sultan, in the abodes of the blessed, have urged the writer
      to the task which he has undertaken; but no one has made
      the same demand on behalf of Sultan Mahmud. It therefore
                                                                 1577

        seemed expedient to him that he should select and commit
        to writing all that related to the Martyr King. He would
        not, however, have been able to succeed, even in this,
        without the directions he graciously received from the
        spirit of the departed. When he had set about his selection,
        and had engaged earnestly in the work, one night the spirit
        of the deceased martyr appeared to the writer in a vision,
        and most condescendingly expressed, with his blessed
        tongue, his approval of the work. Being thus graciously
        honoured, the author humbly replied that he had begun the
        work, and begged for assistance wherever his narration
        might be too high, or too low, too short, or too long. The
        spirit, with great affability, directed the author to write,
        and that he would attend to him and assist him. The present
        work is the result, to which the author has given the name
        Mir-at-i Mas'udi. May the reader of it also be (mas'ud)
        blessed. This is the author's prayer. The biography of the
        King of Martyrs having been derived from the aforesaid
        history, is here related in five chapters (dastans). Sundry
        incidents, and miraculous statements, which have been
        found in trustworthy books, have been selected, and, after
        being verified by oral communications with the author's
        spiritual visitors, have been inserted in the present work."
1429.     The editor of "History of India" thereafter has termed
the book as a historical romance and says that the book mainly
seems to rest on the last word "Tawarikh-i-Mahmudi" of Mulla
Muhammad Ghaznawi but at places it is difficult to rely on the
narration. We do not find it expedient to go further except to
point out that in all the subsequent Gazetteers, this history of
invasion of Ayodhya by "Syed Salar Masud" has been followed
                                                                           1578

referring to Elliot and Dowson's "History of India" Vol. II page
530/531 where the learned authors got confused by identifying
"Ajudhan" as "Ayodhya" though the two are different places.
"Ajudhan" was a place in "Punjab" while "Ayodhay" is much
far therefrom. This mistake unfortunately has continued in a lot
of History books also which have been published until recently.
1430.          Dr. T.P. Verma, Historian and author of the book
"Ayodhya Ka Itihas Evam Puratatva" (Exhibit 3-Suit 5)
(Book No. 141) who has also written the same fact at page
110/111 in his above titled book, in his cross examination has
admitted this error. He admits that "Salar Masud" never came
to "Ayodhya" and he has wrongly mentioned the same in his
book as is evident from the following:

        traditional spot where Rama was born."
1432.         Again in the later part a directory is appended and
deals with Ayodhya at page 179/180, it says:
              "It is locally affirmed that at the time of the
        Musalman conquest there were three important Hindu
        shrines at Ajodhya and little else. There were the
        Janamsthan temple, the Swargaddwar and the Treta-ka-
        Thakur, and each was successively made the object of
                                                                   1582

        attention of different Musalman rulers. The Janamasthan
        was in Ramkot and marked the birthplace of Rama. In
        1528 A.D. Babar came to Ajodhya and halted here for a
        week. He destroyed the ancient temple and on its site built
        a mosque, still known as Babar's mosque. The materials of
        the old structure were largely employed, and many of the
        columns are in good preservation; they are of close-
        grained black stone, called by the natives kasauti, and
        carved with various devices. Their length is from seven to
        eight feet, and the shape square at the base, centre and
        capital, the rest being round or octagonal. The mosque
        has two inscriptions, one on the outside and the other on
        the pulpit; both are in Persian and bear the date 935
        Hiji. Of the authenticity of the inscriptions there can be
        no doubt, but no record of the visit to Ahodhya is to be
        found in the Musalman historians. It must have occurred
        about the time of his expedition to Bihar."
1433.         Here also Nevill in the footnote has placed reliance
on Elliot and Dowson's "History of India" Vol. 4 page 283
which is english translation of "Tuzak-I Babari" which is said to
be Leyden and Erskine's translation as per the preface of the
book. We have gone through the entire page 283 of the said
book but do not find any fact mentioned about the construction
of disputed site or building mentioned therein.
1434.         After   independence     under    the   authority     of
Government of Uttar Pradesh (Revenue Department) District
Gazetteers of Uttar Pradesh in the revised form were published.
The "Uttar Pradesh District Gazetteers-Faizabad" by Smt.
Esha Basanti Joshi (Book No. 17) was published in 1960 printed
at the Indian Press (Private) Ltd., Allahabad. Copy of the
                                                               1583

frontispiece and pages No.34, 36, 46, 47, 352 and 354 have been
filed as paper No.107C1/54-61 i.e. Ex.13, Suit-5 (Register 20,
pages 109-123). With reference to the construction of disputed
building by Babar and the period it says:
        "The Janmasthan was in Ramkot and marked the
        birthplace of Rama. It seems that in 1528 A.D. Babur
        visited Ayodhya and under his orders this ancient temple
        was destroyed and on the site was built what came to be
        known as Babur's mosque. The material of the old temple
        was largely employed in building the mosque and a few of
        the original columns are still in good preservations; they
        are of cloe grained black stone (kasauti) bearing various
        Hindu bas-reliefs (see Plate I), the outer beam of the main
        structure being of sandal wood. The height of the columns
        is seven to eight feet, the shape of the base, the middle
        section and the capital is square, the rest being round or
        octagonal. There are two inscriptions in Persian, one on
        the outside and the other on the pulpit bearing the date
        935 Hijri."
1435.      Broadly, we find and in fact it is even admitted by Sri
Jilani that the sole basis for determining the period of
construction of the disputed building and to co-relate it with
Emperor Babar is/are the inscription(s) said to be installed in the
disputed building referred to in certain Gazetteers etc. The text
of these inscriptions have been given in different books which
needs threadbare scrutiny to find out whether the disputed
building was constructed in 1528 by or under the order of
Emperor Babar is correct or not.
1436.      The first document which has reproduced the text of
said inscription(s) is the publication of Archaeological Survey
                                                                                 1584

of India titled as "The Sharqi Architecture of Jaunpur; with
notes on Zafarabad, Sahet-Mahet and Other Places in the
North-Western Provinces and Oudh by A. Fuhrer; Original
edition 1889 (reprinted in 1994) by the Director General
Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi (hereinafter referred
to as "Fuhrer's Report"). This is edited by Z.A.Desai. Chapter-
X thereof refers to the inscriptions i.e., no. XL; XLI; XLII found
at Ayodhya and is supported with the inscriptions found by
Fuhrer at Ayodhya. It says that there were three inscriptions
wherefrom he (Fuhrer) formed the opinion that the said building
was constructed at Ayodhya in A.H. 930, or A.D. 1523, by Mir
Khan, on the very spot where the old temple Janam Asthanam
of Ramachandra was standing.
1437.         The inscription No. XL was over the central mihrab,
written in Arabic characters and gives twice the Kalimah as
under:
        ‫سول اللہ‬
               ُ ‫ل الّلہ ُمحّمد َر‬
                                 ّ‫ل ا‬           ‫سول اللہ‬
                                                       ُ ‫ل الّلہ ُمحّمد َر‬
                                                                         ّ‫ل ا‬
         "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is His Prophet."
                                        (English Translation by "the Author")
1438.           Inscription No. XLI was found on the mimbar (right
hand side of the disputed building) written in Persian poetry,
the metre being Ramal, in six lines:
        ‫بمنشاے بابر خد یو جہاں‬

                                           (English Translation by "the Author")
1439.              Inscription XLII was found above the entrance door
of the disputed building written in Persian poetry, the metre
being Ramal in ten lines. He further says that some characters of
the second and whole third lines are completely defaced:

(English Translation by Author) 1440. After referring the aforesaid inscriptions and text, Fuhrer on page 68, Chapter X has made the following observations:
"The old temple of Ramachandra at Janamasthanam must have been a very fine one, for may of its columns have been used by the Musalmans in the construction of Babar's masjid. These are of strong, close-grained, dark-coloured or black stone, called by the natives kasauti, "touch-stone slate," and carved with different devices. They are from seven to eight feet long, square at the base, centre and capital, and round or octagonal intermediately."
1441. The second extremely relied work is "Babur- Nama" by A.S. Beveridge (first published in 1921) (reprinted in LPP 1989, 1997, 2000), two volumes in a single bound book (Book No. 6). Besides the book itself, extract of some of the pages of the said book (of different editions) have also been filed by the parties which are exhibits as under:
(i) Paper No. 78 A-2/ 21-24 (Ex. J5, Suit-4) (Register Volume 13, page 39-45)

(vii) Paper No. 107C1/ 71-74 (Ex.16, Suit-5) (Register 20 page 145-159) 1442. Appendix U at page LXXVII, LXXVIII and LXXIX refers to two such inscriptions, one inside the mosque and another outside the mosque. Photocopy of the aforesaid pages of Appendix U have been placed on record as Exhibit T3 (Suit-4) (Paper No. 43A-1/22-24), (Register 18 page 45-49). It appears from Appendix U that she got the text of the two inscriptions through the Deputy Commissioner of Fyzabad on an enquiry made by her husband about two inscriptions mentioned by several Gazetteers said to be existed on the Babar mosque at Ayodhya. However, at the bottom, note 2, she says that while reproducing the text a few slight changes in the turm of expression have been made for clearness sake. The text of the inscription inside the mosque as quoted in Babar-Nama by A.S. Beveridge is as under:
‫بفرمودہ شاہ بابر کہ عدلش‬ ‫بنایست تأ کاخ گردوں ُملقی‬ ‫بنا کرد ایں ُمہبط ُقدسیاں‬ ‫امیر سعادت نشان میر باقی‬ ‫بود خیر باقی چو سال بنایش‬ ‫عیاں شد کہ گفتم بود خیر باقی‬ **¼1½ cQjewn&,&'kkgs ckcj fd vny'k] fcukbLr ck&dk[k+ xjnwW eqykdh+A ¼2½ fcuk dnZ&,&egcrs dqnfl;ka jk vehjs lvknr fu'kka ehj ckd+h ¼3½ cqon [kSjs ckd+h o lkys fcukb'k v;ka 'kqn pwa xqQre cqon [k+Sj ckd+h** (Hindi Transliteration by Court) **1- lezkV ckcj ds vkns'kkuqlkj ftldk U;k; ,d ,slh bekjr gS tks vkdk'k ds egy ls tk feyh gSA 2- HkkX;oku uokc ehj ckd+h us Qfj'rksa ds mrjus ds bl LFkku dh vk/kkj f'kyk j[khA 3- blds vk/kkj dk o"kZ pwafd ,d [kSj ckd+h ¼'kk'or HkykbZ½ gSA vr% esjk ;g dFku Li"V gqvk **coqn [kSj ckd++h** ¼;g Hkyk dkjukek lnSo ckdh jgs½^^ (Hindi Translation by Court) "(1) By the command of the Emperor Babur whose justice is an edifice reaching up to the very height of the heavens.

‫کہ خالق جملہ عالم لمکانی‬ ‫بنام أنکہ داناھست اکبر‬ ‫کہ سرور انبیائ دو جہانی‬ ‫درود مصطف ٰی بعد ازستایش‬ ‫فسانہ در جہاں بابر قلندر کہ شد در دورگیتی کامرانی‬ **1- cukes vkafd nkuk gLr vdcj fd [+kkfyd+ tqeyk vkye ykedkuh 2- nw:ns eqLrQk ckn vt+ lrk;'k fd ljoj vafc;k&,&nks tgkuh 3- Qlkuk nj tgka ckcj d+yUnj fd 'kqn nj nkSjs xhrh dkejkuh** (Hindi Transliteration) **1- mlds uke ls tks lcls egku cqf}eku gS tks lkjs lalkj dk L="Vk ,oa LFkku dh dSn ls eqDr gS 2- mldh iz'kalk ds ckn eksgEen eqLrQk lYyYykgks vySfg olYye ij n:n gks tks nksuksa lalkj ds ufc;ksa ds ljnkj gSaA 3- ckcj dyanj dk ;g pjpk lkjs lalkj esa O;kid gS fd og ,d lQy lezkV gSaA** (Hindi Translation) "1.

3. In the world, it is widely talked about Qalandar Babur that he is a successful emperor." (E.T.C.) 1444. With respect to the second inscription that is outside the mosque, the Beveridge said that it is incomplete.
1445. The third set of text of inscription we are confronted with, is that published in "Epigraphia Indica-Arabic & Persian Supplement (In continuation of Epigraphia Indo- Moslemica) 1964 and 1965" reprinted 1987 published by the Director General Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi. On page 49, the chapter begins with the heading "Inscriptions of Emperor Babur" said to be written by the Late Maulvi M. Ashraf Husain and edited by Z.A.Desai. Editor's note in the aforesaid Chapter is of some importance:
"A rough draft of this article by the author, who was my predecessor, was found among sundry papers in my office. At the time of his retirement in 1953, he had left a note saying that it might be published after revision by his successor. Consequently, the same is published here after incorporation of fresh material and references and also, extensive revision and editing. The readings have been also checked, corrected and supplemented with the help of my colleague, Mr. S.A.Rahim, Epigraphical Assistant,-Editor."
1446. On page 58 under sub-chapter VIII-X, "Inscriptions Dated A.H. 935, from Ajodhya", the author has referred to three inscriptions said to have existed at Babur's mosque. The author's comments about those inscriptions are:
"These three records are from Ajyodhya, in Fyzabad district of Uttar Pradesh. Ajodhya, called Ayodhya in ancient works, is a place of great antiquity. It was the earliest capital of the kingdom of Kosala in the later Vedic period, which may be traced down to 600 B.C. In the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ, the Gupta dynasty ruled over it and called it Saket, by which name it is also known in the Ramayana. From the seventh century onwards, a period of neglect ensued and according to Muslim historians, parties enjoyed hunting in its vicinity."
The chief fame of Ajodhya lies in its being the birth-
place of Sri Rama, the deified son of Raja Dasaratha and hero of the Ramayana. At the Muslim conquest, three important temples are reported to have existed here, viz. Janmasthana or birth-place Temple, the Treta-ki-Thakur or the place where Sri Rama performed a great sacrifice in commemoration of which he set up images of himself and his wife Sita, and the Svargadvaram or Rama-Darbar, which is believed to be the place where he was cremated. The second and third are popularly believed to have been pulled down by Aurangzeb, and on the site of the first the present Baburi mosque is stated to have been built. The supposition is apparently anachronistic inasmuch as Aurangzeb was born about a century after A.H. 935, the date of Babur's record, and so the demolition could not have taken place so late.
The Baburi-Masjid, which commands a picturesque view from the riverside, was constructed according to A.Fuhrer in A.H. 930 (1523-24 A.D.) but his chronology, based upon incorrect readings of inscriptions supplied to him, is erroneous. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi only in A.H. 933 (1526 A.D.), and moreover, the year of construction, recorded in two of the three inscriptions studied below, is clearly A.H. 935 (1528-29 A.D.). Again, it was not built by Mir Khan as stated by him. The order for building the mosque seems to have been issued during Babur's stay at Ajodhya in A.H. 934 (1527-28 A.D.), but no mention of its completion is made in the Babur Nama. However, it may be remembered that his diary for the year A.H. 934 (1527-28 A.D.) breaks off abruptly, and throws the reader into the dark in regard to the account of Oudh.
The mosque consists of three compartments, each crowned by a dome. The squinch-arches and stalactite pendentives turn each aisle of the prayer-chamber into a squarish room. The drums of the domes inside were originally relieved by arched recesses, and the central dome was embellished with ornamental incised plaster discs, but the present domes were only reconstructed in the thirties of this century and are devoid of any original features.
The mosque contains a number of inscriptions. On the eastern facade is a chhajja, below which appears a Quranic text and above, an inscription in Persian verse. On the central mihrab are carved religious texts such as the Kalima (First Creed), etc. On the southern face of the pulpit was previously fixed a stone slab bearing a Persian inscription in verse. There was also another inscription in Persian verse built up into the right hand side wall of the pulpit. Of these, the last-mentioned two epigraphs have disappeared. They were reportedly destroyed in the communal vandalism in 1934 A.D., but luckily, I managed to secure an inked rubbing of one of them from Sayyid Badru'l Hasan of Fyzabad. The present inscription, restored by the Muslim community, is not only in inlaid Nasta'liq characters, but is also slightly different from the original, owing perhaps to the incompetence of the restorers in deciphering it properly.
The readings and translations of the historical epigraphs mentioned above, except in the case of one, were published by Fuhrer and Mrs. Beveridge, but their readings are so incomplete, inaccurate and different from the text that their inclusion in this article is not only desirable but also imperative.
The epigraph studied below was inscribed on a slab of stone measuring about 68 by 48 cm., which was built up into the southern side of the pulpit of the mosque, but is now lost, as stated above. It is edited here from the estampage obtained from Sayyid Badru'l Hasan of Fyzabad. Its three-line text consists of six verses in Persian, inscribed in ordinary Naskh characters within floral borders. It records the construction of the mosque by Mir Baqi under orders from emperor Babur and gives the year A.H. 935 (1528-29 A.D.) in a chronogram." 1447. The inscriptions found at the southern side of the pulpit of the mosque is said to be found inscribed on a slab of stone measuring about 68 by 48 cm. He says that the original is lost. The quoted inscription is one edited from the estampage obtained from Sayyid Badru'l Hasan of Fyzabad. Further explanation at note 4 at the bottom at page 59 given by author is as under:
"It may be argued that since this epigraph is not quoted in Fuhrer's SAJ, the slab had already disappeared before he wrote. But that is not the case, since the tablet was found there in 1906-07 A.D. by Maulavi M.

(English Translation by Author) 1449. The Fuhrer's inscription no. XLI which he mentions that the same was found inside the mosque on the mimbar (right hand side of the disputed building) has been turmed as second inscription by Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain. It consists of three couplets arranged in six lines. He (Hussain) clearly admits non existence of the said inscription by observing "the epigraphical Tablet" which was built up into right hand side wall of the pulpit, does not exist now, and, therefore, the text of the inscription is quoted here from Furher's work, for the same reason, its illustration could not be given." Sri Husain/Desai however, did not agree to the reading of the inscription by Fuhrer and observed that Furher's reading does not appear free from mistakes.
1450. About the third inscription, on page 60/61 of the book, the author has given narration as follows:
"The third record of Babur in the Ajodhya mosque, comprising a fragment of eight Persian verses of mediocre quality and a colophon, appears over the central entrances to the prayer-chamber above the chajja. The four-line text is executed in fairly good Naskh characters in relief amidst floral borders, on a slab measuring about 2 m. by 55 cm. The text is fairly well preserved, and Fuhrer must have been misinformed to affirm that 'a few characters of the second and the whole third lines are completely defaced'. The purport of the record is the same as that of the previous epigraphs, but here an additional edifice is also mentioned : In verse six, in line three, a fort-wall (hisar) is said to have been built along with the mosque in A.H. 935 (1528-29 A.D.), by Mir Baqu, who is here called the second Asaf and councillor of the state."
1451. The text of the third inscription is as under :

From perusal of the text of the inscription said to be found inside the mosque i.e., the 6-lines inscription it is evident that the text quoted by Fuhrer, Beveridge and Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain has apparent and demonstrable differences. The first line of the text by the three reads as under:
        *cea'kk;s ckcj [kn;w tgka"                 (Fuhrer)
        **cQjewn&,&'kkgs ckcj fd vny'k]**         (Beveridge)
**cQjewn&,&'kkg ckcj fd vny'k]** (Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain) 1456. Similarly, we find difference in line 2 which is demonstrated as under:
**c'kkus fd ck dk[k+ xjnwW buk a ** (Fuhrer) **fcukbLr ck&dk[k+ xjnwW eqykdh+A** (Beveridge) **fcukbsLr ck&dk[k+ xjnwW eqykdh+A** (Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain) 1457. The third line is also not the same.

**vehjs lvknr fu'kka ehj [kka** (Fuhrer) **vehjs lvknr fu'kka ehj ckd+h** (Beveridge) **vehjs lvknr fu'kka ehj ckd+h** (Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain) 1459. Fifth line of all the three is different as demonstrated below:
**cekun ges' kk pq u k a ckfu;'k** (Fuhrer) **cqon [kSjs ckd+h fd rkjh[+k efLtn]** (Beveridge) **cqon [kSjs ckd+h o lkys fcukb'k]** (Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain) 1460. Sixth line of Beveridge and Maulvi F. Ashraf Hussain is the same but different from Fuhrer as seen below:

The next inscription which according to Fuhrer was a ten-line Persian poetry, Beveridge could get only three lines thereof and termed incomplete, Maulvi M.Ashraf Husain however found complete and running in about 10/11 lines. The distinction therein are:

We are extremely perturbed by the manner in which Ashraf Husain/Desai have tried to give an impeccable authority to the texts of the alleged inscriptions which they claim to have existed on the disputed building though repeatedly said that the original text has disappeared. The fallacy and complete misrepresentation on the part of author in trying to give colour of truth to this text is writ large from a bare reading of the write up. We are really at pains to find that such blatant fallacious kind of material has been allowed to be published in a book published under the authority of ASI, Government of India, without caring about its accuracy, correctness and genuineness of the subject. We have already given write up of Ashraf Husain. Firstly, he said that the mistake was committed in number of inscriptions. He claims that on the eastern façade is a Chhajja below which appears a Quranic text and above thereto an inscription in Persian verse. Then he says that on the central mehrab are carved religious text such as Kalma (First creed), etc. Then he says that on the southern face of the pulpit previously there affixed a stone slab bearing a Persian inscription in verse and another inscription in Persian verse was built up into right hand side wall of the pulpit. Both these inscriptions i.e., the one claimed to be on the southern face of the pulpit and the other on the right hand side wall of the pulpit are said to be non-available by observing "of these the last mentioned two epigraphs have disappeared". The time of disappearance according to Maulvi Ashraf Husain was 1934 A.D. when a communal riot took place at Ayodhya. However, he claimed to have got an inked rubbing on one of the two inscriptions from Syed Badrul Hasan of Faizabad. The whereabouts of Syed Badrul Hasan , who he was, what was his status, in what way and manner he could get that ink rubbing of the said inscription and what is the authenticity to believe it to be correct when original text of the inscription are not known.
There is nothing to co-relate the text he got as the correct text of the inscription found in the disputed building claimed to have lost in 1934.
1464. He also admits that the existing inscription which was restored by Muslim community was 'inlaid nastaliq' character but simultaneously says that the restored inscription is slightly different from the original and this distinction he attributes perhaps to the incompetence of the restorer in deciphering it properly. When the original was already lost and there was nothing to verify the text of restored inscription with the original, neither the restored one can be relied upon nor it is understandable as to how he could have any occasion to compare the restored one with the alleged nonest/lost original one. It appears that the text which he got from Syed Badrul Hasan of Faizabad treated by him to be correct and taking it as the original text he has proceeded accordingly. It is also interesting to note that in the footnote realising this difficulty at item no.4, he has said that this tablet was found in 1906-07 A.D. by Maulvi M. Suhaib of the office of Regional Archaeological Surveyor, Northern Survey (Annual progress report of the office of Archaeological Surveyor, Northern Survey Agra for 1906-1907), Appendix 'D'). We however, find it difficult to understand this reference if the inscription was fixed on the wall of the disputed building, the question of finding tablet by Maulvi M.Ashraf Husain does not arise. If what he intends to suggest is that the inscription was noticed by Maulvi M. Suhaib in 1906-07 and he has made some reference in the annual progress report of 1906-1907, the text of the inscription if was published in the said report, the author ought to have taken material from such report and not from a stranger namely Syed Badrul Hasan of Faizabad whose credentials and authenticity is unknown and whether any such person actually existed or not, even this is doubtful, as has been argued by Sri Mishra and we find substance therein.
1465. The matter does not rest here. Ashraf Husain has critically commented upon the reading of one or two inscriptions as published by Fuhrer and Beveridge stating that "....their readings are so incomplete, inaccurate and different from the text that their inclusion in this article is not only desirable but also imperative."
1466. Once the alleged two inscriptions are lost and one of such inscriptions according to Sri Husain was found by Fuhrer who has published its text, without having either the inscription itself with him (Husain) or the authenticated stampage of the text of such inscription, how there could be any occasion for Husain to claim that the text given by Fuhrer is incorrect. Similarly, he also could not have any occasion to compare that text with that of Beveridge. Admittedly, the date of publication of such inscription by Fuhrer and A.S. Beveridge is before the date of disappearance i.e. 1934 as alleged by Ashraf Hussain. Therefore, so far as Fuhrer and Beveridge are concerned they could have an occasion to peruse the inscription that was installed before 1934 but so far as Maulvi M. Ahsraf Husain is concerned, this occasion in his own words, could not have arisen. The text, description and whatever had been set up by Ashraf Husain in respect of the above inscription is unbelievable and lacks trustworthiness. We are constrained to observe at this stage that in the matter of historical events and that too, when it bears a religious importance and the matter has also seen serious disputes between two communities, the persons who are connected with history etc. must behave responsibly and before making any write up, should check up, cross check and verify very carefully what they are writing since the consequences of their write up may be dangerous and irreparable. 1467. We move on to one more aspect. Even the text of the inscription which Ashraf Husain has given in plate 17(b), he says that the same is not what was printed in the existing inscription as restored by Muslim community after 1934 riots but the same is an added version from the stampage obtained from Syed Badrul Hasan of Faizabad. At this stage, we are unable to compare even the restored text of the inscription as the same is not available and Maulvi M. Ashraf Hussain instead of giving the existing text as it is of the restored inscription has changed it according to his whims and caprices. 1468. Coming to the authenticity of the text of the two inscriptions given by Beveridge, we find that she herself had neither read the said texts nor visited Ayodhya at any point of time. She claims to have received copy of the text through some correspondence made by her husband, Henry Beveridge, an I.C.S. Officer in British India Government. 1469. The text of two inscriptions are the copy which she claims to have received from Deputy Commissioner of Faizabad on an inquiry made by her husband. In this regard at page 656, foot note 3 at the bottom she has said:
"that he spent a few days near Aud (Ajodhya) to settle its affairs. The D.G. Of Fyzbaa (H.E. Nevill) p.173 says "In 1528 AD, Babur came to Ajodhya (Aud) and halted a week. The destroyed the ancient temple" (marking the birth-place of Rama) "and on its site built a mosque, still known as Babur's Mosque..... It has two inscriptions, one on the outside, one on the pulpit; both are in Persian; and bear the date 935 AH." This date may be that of the competition of the building.--(Corrigendum:-On f.339 n. 1, I have too narrowly restricted the use of the name Sarju. Babur used it to describe what the maps of Arrowsmith and Johnson shew, and not only what the Gazetteer of India Map of the United Provinces does,. It applies to the Sarda (f.339) as Babur uses it when writing of the fords.".
1470. Perhaps she went through the description of the disputed site in the light of the observations made by Sri Nevill who wrote 1904 -1905 Gazetteer (Supra). Whether the alleged text made available to her by the Dy. Commissioner, Faizabad was an ink stampage of the text of the alleged two inscriptions or it was obtained by him through somebody else by reading the contents or the manner in which the said text was collected, is not known. Rather there appears to be something otherwise. Footnote 2 on page lxxvii , Appendics 'U' of Baburnama (Memoirs of Babur) shows that some changes were made by Beveridge also:
"2. A few slight changes in the turn of expressions have been made for clearness sake."
1471. To what extent the corrections have been made and what was necessity thereof is not ascertainable. Why a verbatim reproduction could not be made is also not understandable. At least there is nothing on record enabling us to examine this aspect of the matter. The second inscription, text whereof is quoted at page lxxviii, Appendices 'U' of Baburnama by Beveridge, we find that the same is incomplete and the reason assigned by Beveridge is that it is not now legible. The text of second inscription was not legible to Beveridge whose book was first published in 1914/1921. We fail to understand how its complete text could be available to Maulvi M. Ashraf Husain after more than forty years thereafter who got it published in Epigraphia Indica -Arabic and Persian Supplement 1965 (supra).
1472. From the text of A. Fuhrer the period of construction of the disputed building is not 1528 AD and it also does not say that the same was built by Mir Baqi. The inscription no. XLI, line four mentions the name of Mir Khan and inscription no. XLII shows the period of construction as Hijra 930. The text given by Sri Sushil Srivastava, PW 15 in his book "The Disputed Mosque-A Historical Enquiry" is based on the text of two inscriptions given by A.S. Beveridge and Prof. Radhey Shyam as is evident from page 78-79 of his statement. Athar Hussain's text is the reproduction from Beveridge. Dr. Radhey Shyam has taken the text of three inscriptions from M. Ashrat Hussain's write-up published in Epigraphia Indica-Arabic and Persian Supplement in 1964-65.
1473. The apparent distinction, as appear from Fuhrer's reading of the inscription, is:
(a) There is no mention of word of "honour" before the name of Babar.
(b) Instead of "Mir Baqi" it mentions "Mir Khan".
(c) There is no use of the word "mosque" but it mentions "lofty building" and also shows no dedication to Almighty.
This is in respect to the first inscription.
1474. Then comes the second inscription, where the marked distinction is the date i.e. 930 A.H. (1523 AD). It is a well known fact that in 1523 AD Babar was not in Hindustan but in Kandhar/Kabul.
1475. Archaeological Survey of India also published a book "The Monumental Antiquities And Inscriptions In The North- Western Provinces And Oudh" described and arranged by A. Fuhrer published by the Superintendent, Government Press, N.- W. Provinces and Oudh, 1891. Copy of the frontispiece as well as pages No.295, 296 and 297 thereof have been filed as Paper No.107C1/33-36 i.e. Ex.9, Suit-5 (Register Vol.20, Pages 67-
73). We have the entire book published in 1967 by Rameshwar Singh, Indological Book House, Varanasi (Book No.94). Pages No.295-297 are verbatim the same filed as paper Nos.107C1/34-
36. About construction of building in dispute, on page 297 it says, "It is locally affirmed that at the Musalman conquest there were three important Hindu temples at Ayodhya; these were the Janamasthanam, the Svargadvaram, and the Treta-ke-Thakur. On the first of these Mir Khan built a masjid, in A.H. 930, during the reign of Babar, which still bears his name." The reference has been made to Archaeological Reports (New Series), Vol.1, page 67.
1476. Ex. 81 (Suit-4) (Paper No. 216C1/1-21) consists of certain pages from book "Babarnama" translated by Yugjeet Navalpuri, first published 1974, third publication 1996, 1998 and reprint 2002 by Sahitya Academy, New Delhi. The Editorial Note says that the book consist of Hindi translation by Navalpuri of F.G. Talbot's Edition of the "Memoirs of Baber".
However, the Chapter "Introduction" running from Page 9 to 18, pages 438 to 456 giving history from AH (1527 AD) and then for the year AH 936, page 510 has been filed. Sri Jilani from the above extract of the book has sought to submit that there is no mention either of entry of Babar to Ayodhya or any act of demolition of any temple or construction of a Mosque. For the date of construction of the disputed building in 1528 AD, he refers to Footnote 48 on page 447 which refers two inscriptions at the disputed building as under :

The language of the inscriptions is same as that is quoted in Baburnama by Beveridge (supra) who claimed to have text of the two inscriptions from the Deputy Commissioner of Faizabad and has referred to Nevill's Gazetteer of 1905 on page 556 of the book. Reading of the words "Mir Baqi" as "Shaghawal", "Tashkandi" appears to be the understanding of the author himself inasmuch it is not in dispute that both the names i.e. Baqi Shaghawal and Baqi Tashkandi have been mentioned separately in "Baburnama" and there is nothing to co-relate the two being name of the same person or that to corelate with 'Mir Baqi'. Sri Jilani also could not place anything to co-relate Mir Baqi with Baqi Shaghawal or Baqi Tashkandi to show that they were the names of one and the same person. We also find that on page 11 (Paper No. 216C1/5, the writer has mentioned : ^^'kdkoqy us11, ,d lkS chl bZxkp12 dh nwjh pkj fnu esa gh r;

In Regular Suit No. 29 of 1945 (Shia Central Waqf Board of Waqf Vs. Sunni Central Board of Waqf), it appears that the Court issued a direction to record the text of the inscriptions found at the disputed building. On 26.3.1946, Sri A.
Akhtar Abbas went to read the inscriptions and noted on his inspection note as under :
"Inspection Notes 26.3.46 Present ... Mussama Khoja M. Yaqub, counsel of parties (besides others) Inspected the mosque in suit & found the following inscriptions on a stone table near the pulpit-

There is another tablet at the central arch of the mosque facing the court-yard and it contains the following couplets:-

1479. In the book Ayodhya Ka Itihas by Sri Avadhwasi Lala Sitaram, first published in 1932, reprinted in 2001, published by Arya Book Depot, New Delhi, the transcript of the in-script has been mentioned at page 115/116 which is a verbatim copy of the text quoted by A.S. Beveridge. The learned author has given, however, totally different reasons and history of the construction of the disputed building. There is nothing to show the basis on which he has written the said history. Sri Jilani has castigated the contents of this entire book of Lala Sitaram contending that neither he was a historian nor there is any authority mentioned in his book to generate confidence for what has been written therein, therefore, this book is not reliable. This author retired from the office of Deputy Collector as appearing from the Forward of his book written by Sri Devendra Swaroop.
1480. The above discussion tells us that basically there are three version in respect to the text or transcript of the inscriptions fixed on the disputed building. The text available to A.Fuhrer says that "a firmament-like lofty strong building was erected by an auspicious noble Mir Khan under the command of Babar in the year 930 AH i.e. 1523 AD and foundation of the said building was laid down by the King of China and Turkey in presence of Babar". The transcript made available to Beveridge reveal that "under the command of Emperor Babar, good hearted Mir Baki built that alighting place of angels in 935 AH i.e. 1528-29". The last one is that of ASI report of 1964-65 edited by Z.A.Desai, the transcript whereof says that "by the order of King Babar that descending place of Angles was built by the fortunate noble Mir Baki". In respect to another inspection, Desai text says that "a lofty building and lasting house (of God) was founded by Mir (and) Khan (Baqi)". The words placed within brackets are that of Mr. Husain or Dr. Desai's own insertion and do not find place in the text of the inscription as such.
1481. The fourth one, which can be said to be very recent and inspire more confidence than other is the one when pursuant to the order of the learned Civil Judge, Faizabad, Sri A. Akhtar Ahasan made inspection of the disputed structure on 26th March, 1946 and obtained text of two inscriptions fixed on the disputed building at that time. This text, as is reproduced in judgment dated 30.03.1946 (Ex. A42, Suit-1) in R.S. No.29/1945 says that in the first inscription the words are "by the order of Shah Babar, Amir Mir Baki built the resting place of angles in 923 A.H. i.e. 1516-17 AD". In respect to second inscription, he says that "Mir Baki of Isphahan in 935 AH i.e. 1528-29 AD". We find that the reading of text of inscriptions by Civil Judge, Faizabad was earlier than Dr. Z.A.Desai's publication yet there is a good variance with the text of the estampage procured and transcribed by Desai.
1482. In the entire Babar-Nama i.e. all the translations made by various writers, we are not informed that the words "Mir Baki Isfahani" has been mentioned at any place. What has been said is Baki Tashkendi and various other Bakis but not Mir Baki Isfahani. We are informed by Sri P.N.Mishra, which is not disputed by other learned counsels, that Taskend is a city of Uzbekistan while Isfahan is a province of Iran. 1483. Sri Mishra, on the basis of the above facts submits that Baki Isfahani and Baki Taskandi cannot be regarded as one and the same person. Baki Isfahani a person not known to Babar having not been mentioned in Babarnama could not have any kind of authority at all in the period of Babar. It is therefore safe to presume that it is fictitious name which adds and fortify the argument that the inscription has been implanted later on with a transcription which is fictitious and false and had no factual authenticity.
1484. The above discussion raises a serious doubt over the genuinity and authenticity of the text or transcript of the inscriptions and the time when they were fixed on the disputed building. To base a finding in a judicial proceeding while adjudicating a dispute of this nature, it would be improper and against the all cannons of the principles applicable in such matter. However, there are some more facts and material which needs to be considered before recording a final opinion on the matter.
1485. The very first document/historical book in this regard is "Tuzuk-i-babri", i.e., "Baburnama" or "daily diary of Babar" which has been translated and published by several well known authors and some of them are considered to be the authentic work internationally also. Broadly the learned counsels for the parties and the Expert Historians have also not disputed authenticity of such work which we now propose to refer. 1486. Babur-nama (Tuzuk-i-babri) commences its description from 899 Hizra (1493-94 AD). In the total life span of 47 years and 10 months, the description of only 18 years of Babur's life is available and that too in various spans. The period, for which the details are not available, are as under:
1. History from the birth (14th February, 1483 AD) till Singhasanarohan Ramazan 899 Hijri (June 14, 1494 AD)
2. Description from 908 Hijri (1503 AD) till 909 Hijri (1504 AD)
3. Description from 914 Hijri (1508 AD) till 925 Hijri (1519 AD)
4. Description from 4 Safar 926 Hijri(15th January 1520 AD) till 30 Muharram 932 Hijri (16th November, 1525 AD)
5. Description from 13 Rajab 934 Hijri (3rd April 1528 AD) till 2 Muharram 934 Hijri (17th September, 1528 AD)
6. History of following days of 934 Hijri (1528-29 AD):
(a) 1, 2 Muharram 934 Hijri (16, 17th September 1528 AD)

(c) 6 Safar 934 Hijri (20th October 1528 AD) to 8 Safar 934 Hijri (22nd October 1528 AD)
(d) 11 Safar 934 Hijri (25th October 1528 AD) to 20th Safar 934 Hijri (3rd November 1528 AD)
(e) 29 Safar 934 Hijri (12th November 1528 AD) to 8 Rabi-ul-Avval (20th November 1528 AD)

(k) 5 Zikad (11th July 1528 AD) till 11 Zikad (17th July 1529 AD)
(l) 20 Zikad (27th July 1529 AD) till 4 Zilhijja (10th August 1529 AD)
(m) 11 Zilhijja (17th August 1529 AD) till 29 Zilhijja (4th September 1529 AD)
7. 4 Muharram 936 Hijri (8th September 1529 AD) till 6 Jamadi-ul-Avval 937 Hijri (26th December 1530 AD).
1487. In India, Babar came in 1526 AD and the description available of that period till his death is as under:
1. From 1 Safar 932 Hijri (17 November 1525 AD) till 12 Rajab 934 Hijri (2nd April 1528 AD)
2. From 3 Muharram 934 Hijri (18th September 1528 AD) till 3 Moharram 936 Hijri (7th September 1529 AD). In this way the description of only three days of first month of 936 Hijri is available. The description of many days in between 935 Hijri is also not available.
1488. The missing record is of the period 2nd April, 1528 A.D. to 17th September, 1528 A.D. which is crucial for this matter. Out of this period, 2nd April, 1528 to 15th April, 1528 was part of 934 A.H. and 15th September, 1528 to 17th September, 1528 was part of 935 A.H. It means in the crucial year i.e. 935 A.H., the missing record is only of three days. Therefore, non mention of anything about disputed in 935 A.H. building in Babar-Nama does not sound to any reason. 1489. On crossing of the Babar's army led by his commander Sultan Chin Taimur, they found that Bayazid and Biban had already fled away and therefore, no fight at Ayodhya could have occurred. That being so, the question of killing of any Muslim and making of grave at the disputed site does not arise. 1490. The Manuscripts (in short "MS") of Baburnama, as available has been noticed by Mrs. A.S. Beveridge based on the magazine published by Royal Asiatic Society, Landon in 1900 AD:
1. MS written by Babur
2. MS sent to Khwaja Kalan
3. MS written by Humaun
4. MS possessed by Alphinston
5. MS kept at British Museum, Landon
6. MS in the India office of British Government
7. MS of Asiatic Society, Bengal
8. MS at Mysore
9. MS of Biblothika Lindesiyana.
10. MS at Hyderabad
11. MS of St. Peteres Berg University.
12. MS kept at foreign office of St. Peters Berg
13. MS kept at Asiatic Society Museum of St. Peters Berg
14. MS of Bukhara
15. MS of Nazerbe Turkistan 1491. It is said that probably Babur got prepared two MS but presently none is available / traceable. Similarly MS sent to Khwaja Kalan, which is referred in his (Babur's) description dated 4th March, 1529 is also not available/traceable. Even otherwise since it is said to have been sent on 4th March, 1529, it could not have been completed after 4th March, 1959. MS of Mysore that is possessed by Tepu Sultan is also not available / traceable.
1492. Elphinston purchased the MS of Babur at Peshawar in 1809 AD, which probably was prepared between 1543 to 1593 AD and the said MS is kept in the Advocate's library, Edimbara. 1493. Dr. Leyden translated some of the part of Babur's autobiography from the MS of Elphinston and Erskin made corrections in his translation on the basis of the said MS. 1494. MS of Biblothika Lindesiyana was purchased in 1865 AD and is incomplete.
1495. MS of Hyderabad was made available to Mrs. Beveridge from the library of Sir Salar Jang. It is said to be prepared in 1700 AD. It is most complete available MS, as claimed by Mrs. A.S. Beveridge. She has written her translation of 'Baburnama' on the basis thereof.
1496. MS of St. Petersberg is said to have been prepared from another MS copied in 1617 AD. Dr. George Jaikab Kehar prepared the said MS in 1737 but the MS where from it was prepared is not traceable. Elminski published Turkish Edition of Baburnama in 1857 AD on the basis of the said MS and French translation of Babur-nama made by Dr. Pevet Kotele was also based on the said MS.
1497. From the reading of translation of 'Babur-nama' we do not find any title thereof. However, now it is commonly known as "Babur-nama" or "Tuzuk-i-babri" by all. 1498. In the earlier part of Babur-nama i.e. upto 1508-09 AD, it is in the form of history where the details have been given of various events occurred in different years but from 1519 AD till end, it is a day to day description. 1499. Baburnama was originally written in Turkish. Initially, it was translated in Persian prose by Sheikh Zain Wafai Kwafi. One of the MS of the said translation is in Raza Library, Rampur, U.P. (India) and another is in British Museum, Landon. Another Persian translation was made by Mirza Payanda Hasan Gajnavi in 1586 AD under the orders of Behroz Khan Gajnavi, who in fact made a partial translation and it was completed by Mohd. Kuli Mugul Hisari. The most universal popular Persian translation was made by Mirza Abdurrahim Khane Khana Bin Bairam Khan (Abul Fazal) in 1589 AD.
1500. The first English translation of Babur-nama was attempted by "Dr. John Leyden" in 1810 AD. However, he could not complete the same and died in August, 1811 AD. At the same time "William Erskine" also commenced his English translation from Persian under the instructions of General Sir John Malcom and Elphinstone and completed his work in 1813 AD. Thereafter he found that there was a lot of differences in the work of Dr. John Leyden. Since Leyden had commenced his translation from Turkish MS, Erskine made corrections in his translation and this work was published in 1826 AD under the title "Memoirs of Zehir-ed-Din Muhammad Babur" by "John Laden and William Erskine".
1501. Another translation was made in English by Mrs. Annette Susannah Beveridge, (hereinafter referred to as "Beveridge") under the title "Babur-nama (Memoirs of Babur)". Initially her translation was published in four parts as under :-
i. History prior to Babur's victory of Kabul (the period relating to Phargana) - published in 1912 AD.
ii. From Kabul Victory till India victory ; published in 1914 AD iii. From India's victory till end ; published in 1917 AD iv. Introduction, Glossary etc. ; published in 1921 AD 1502. The complete four parts in two volumes were published collectively in 1922 under the title "The Babar Nama in English".
1503. French translation was made by Pevet-de-Kotele published in 1871 AD.
1504. The learned counsels for the parties have not disputed that the contents of the book of Beveridge's translation of Babur-Nama available to the Court has no difference with the photocopies of some of the pages filed as Exhibits, detailed above.
1505. The parties agree that amongst various books translating "Babur-nama, Mrs. Beveridge's translation is the most authentic and complete. The 'Affairs of Hindustan' commences from page 439 which says:
"The centre of interest in Babur's affairs now moves from Qandahar to a Hindustan torn by faction, of which faction one result was an appeal made at this time to Babur by Daulat Khan Ludi (Yusuf-khail) and 'Alau'd-din 'Alam Khan Ludi for help against Ibrahim."
1506. The details of meeting of Dilawar Khan and Babur giving an occasion to him to come to India has been written by Mrs. Beveridge on page 440 as under :
"b. Reception of Dilawar Khan in Kabul.
Wedding festivities were in progress when Dilawar Khan reached Kabul. He presented himself, at the Char- bagh may be inferred, and had word taken to Babur that an Afghan was at his Gate with a petition. When admitted, he demeaned himself as a suppliant and proceeded to set forth the distress of Hindustan. Babur asked why he, whose family had so long eaten the salt of the Ludis, had so suddenly deserted them for himself. Dilawar answered that his family through 40 years had uphelf the Ludi throne, but that Ibrahim maltreated Sikandar's amirs, had killed 25 of them without cause, some by hanging, some burned alive, and that there was no hope of safety in him. Therefore, he said, he had been sent by many amirs to Babur whom they were ready to obey and for whose coming they were on the anxious watch."
"c. Babur asks a sign.
At the dawn of the day following the feast, Babur prayed in the garden for a sign of victory in Hindustan, asking that it should be a gift to himself of mango or betel, fruits of that land. It so happened that Daulat Khan had sent him, as a present, half-ripened mangoes preserved in honey ; when these were set before him, he accepted them as the sign, and from that time forth, says the chronicler, made preparation for a move on Hindustan."
1507. Babur's expedition to India (Hindustan) this time was the fourth one and commenced in 930 AH i.e. 10th November, 1523 AD. The first battle ensued between Babur and Bihar Khan leaving a section of army of Ibrahim Ludi at Lahor since Daulat Khan had already fled therefrom. Babur defeated Bihar Khan and his troops followed Bihar Khan fugitive men into Lahor, plundered the town and burned some of the bazars. Thereafter Babur moved to Dibalpur and samething happened thereat also i.e. it was stormed, plundered and put to the sword. We need not go into further details about other battles except the major battle against Ibrahim Lodi son of Sikundar Lodi (An Afghan) at Panipat which he (Babar) won on 20th April, 1526 A.D. This battle resulted in killing of about 40-50 thousand soldiers. Babur immediately appointed Humayun to reach Agra and take over the palace as also to mount guard over the Treasure. Some of the confidents of Babur were directed to keep watch on the Treasuries at Delhi.
1508. On 21st April, 1526, Babur visited bank of Jumna, on 24th April, 1526 A.D., he visited Sheikh Nizamud-din Auliya's Tomb on the bank of river Jumna at Delhi and also made an excursion into the Fort of Delhi where he spent night. On next day i.e. 25th April, 1526 A.D., he visited Khwaja Qutbud-din's Tomb, and the Tombs and residences of Suleman Ghiyasu'd-din Balban and Suleman Alauud-din Khilji and his Minar, the Hoze- shamsi, Hoze-i-khas and the Tombs and gardens of Suleman Buhlul Ludi and Sikandar Ludi. On page 476, Mrs. Beveridge mention:
"We bestowed the Military Collectorate (shiqdarlighi) of Dihli on Red Wali, made Dost Diwan in the Dihli district, sealed the treasuries, and made them over to their charge."
1509. On 28th April, 1526 A.D. Babur moved on for Agra and also made an excursion to Tughluqabad. He reached near Agra on 4th May, 1526 A.D. and stayed at the mansion of Sulaiman Farmuli in a suburb of Agra and moved on the next day to Jalal Khan's house. At Agra the garrison did not surrender to Humayun, and, therefore he sat down to watch the roads out of Agra till the arrival of Babur. 1510. The king of Gualiar (Gwaliar) had died in the battle of Panipat but his son and other family members were at Agra at that time. When Humayun reached Agra, they tried to flee away, but could not due to the close guard of outside ways by Humayun's army. They offered a mass of jewels and valuables including the diamond Koh-i-nur to Humayun which was offered by Humayun to Babur on his arrival but Babur gave it to Humayun back. It is said that the said diamond weigh about 320 ratis (8 misqals). On 10th May, 1526 AD, Babur entered the fort of Sultan Ibrahim Ludi at Agra.
1511. The biography though said to have been written de die in diem, but the record of some period being not available, the biography in respect to those dates is admittedly missing. Regarding his activities at Ayodhya, from a perusal of Page 602 of the book, it appears that he reached at some distance above the junction of rivers Ghaghara and Saryu on 28.3.1528, i.e., Saturday the 7th Rajab 934 A.H. The area reigned by Shaikh Bayazid Baqi Shaghawal, along with some others crossed the river and conquered the place. Babur stayed on the Bank of Saryu for sometimes. The autobiography contains the date 2nd April 1528 but thereafter there is a break of narrative between 2nd April to 18th September 1528 AD, i.e. Jumada II 12th, 934 A.H. and Moharram III 935 A.H.
1512. What happened at Ayodhya, whether Babur actually visited Ayodhya or not, nothing is mentioned about it in the said autobiography. The contents of his autobiography of dated 28.3.1528 and 2.4.1528 as contained on Page-602 are reproduced as under :
"(March 28th) On Saturday the 7th of Rajab we dismounted 2 or 3 kurohs from Aud above the junction of the Gagar (Gogra) and Sird(a). Till today Shaikh Bayazid will have been on the other side of the Sird(a) opposite Aud, sending letters to the Sultan and discussing with him, but the Sultan getting to know his deceitfulness, sent word to Qaracha at the Mid-day Prayer and made ready to cross the river. On Qaracha's joining him, they crossed at once to where were some 50 horsemen with 3 or 4 elephants. These men could make no stand; they fled, a few having been dismounted, the heads cut off were sent in.
Following the Sultan there crossed over Bi-khub (var. Ni-khub) Sl. and Tardi Beg (the brother) of Quj Beg, and Baba Chuhra (the Brave), and Baqi Shahghawal, Those who had crossed first and gone on, pursued Shaikh Bayazid till the Evening Prayer, but he flung himself into the jungle and escaped. Chin-timur dismounted late on the bank of standing-water, rode on at mid-night after the rebel, went as much as 40 kurohs (80 m.), and came to where Shaikh Bayazid's family and relations (nisba?) had been; they however must have fled. He sent gallopers off in all directions from that place; Baqi Shaghawal and a few braves drove the enemy like sheep before them, overtook the family and brought in some Afghan prisoners.
We stayed a few days on that ground (near Aud) in order to settle the affairs of Aud. People praised the land laying along the Sird(a) 7 or 8 kurohs (14-16 m.) above Aud, saying it was hunting-ground. Mir Muhammad the raftsman was sent out and returned after looking at the crossing over the Gagar-water (Gogra) and the Sird(a)- water (Chauka?).
(April 2nd) On Thursday the 12th of the month I rode out intending to hunt." (emphasis added) 1513. Page 617 of the above book, mentions activities of 22.10.1528 as under :
"(Oct. 22nd) By this time the treasure of Iskandar and Ibrahim in Dihli and Agra was at an end. Royal orders were given therefore, on Thursday the 8th of Safar, that each stipendiary (wajhdar) should drop into the Diwan, 30 in every 100 of his allowance, to be used for war-material and appliances, for equipment, for powder, and for the pay of gunners and matchlockmen."
1514. For the period, i.e., 2.4.1528 to 18.9.1528, the record of biography whereof is not available, during this period of five and half months, the Babur is said to have proceeded to Junpur (Jaunpur), Chausa, Baksara (Baksar) etc. and was ill for 40 days. Beveridge on Pages 603 and 604 of Babur-Nama has said:
"Mr. Erskine note (Mems. p.381n.) that he found the gap in all MSS. he saw and that historians of Hindustan throw no light upon the transactions of the period. Much can be gleaned however as to Babur's occupations during the 5½ months of the lacuna from his chronicle of 935 AH. which makes several references to occurrences of "last year" and also allows several inferences to be drawn. From this source it becomes know that the Afghan campaign the record of which is broken by the gap, was carried on and that in its course Babur was at Jun-pur (f. 365), Chausa (f. 365b) and Baksara (f. 366-366b); that he swam the Ganges (f. 366b) bestowed Sarun on a Farmuli Shaikh-zada (f. 374b and f. 377), negociated with Rana Sanga's son Bikramajit (f. 342b), ordered a Char-bagh laid out (f. 340), and was ill for 40 days (F. 346b). It may be inferred too that he visited Dulpur (f. 353b), recalled "Askari (f. 339), sent Khwaja Dost-i-khawand on family affairs to Kabul (f. 345b), and was much pre-occupied by the disturbed state of Kabul (see his letters to Humayun and Khawaja Kalan written in 935 AH.).
It is not easy to follow the dates of events in 935 AH. because in many instances only the day of the week or a "next day" is entered. I am far from sure that one passage at least now found s.a. 935 AH. does not belong to 934 AH. It is not in the Hai. Codex (where its place would have been on f. 363b), and, so far as I can see, does not fit with the dates of 935AH. It will be considered with least trouble with its context and my notes (q.v. f.363b and ff. 366- 366b)."
1515. From Page 679 of 'Babur-Nama' by Beveridge, it further appears that Babur received message on 27.5.1529 about taking of 'Luknur' by Baqi and one Abdullah (kitabdar). The extract of the autobiography dated 27.5.1529 is reproduced as under :
"(May 27th) On Friday (19th) I rode out to visit Sikandarpur and Kharid. Today came matters written by 'Abdu'l-lah (kitabdar) and Baqi about the taking of Luknur."
(emphasis added) 1516. On 28.5.1529, it is mentioned that the Babur sent one Kuki along with a troop to join Baqi.
1517. At Page 680 the author (Beveridge) has mentioned about a surprise survival of some record of 934 A.H. and has written that this part of the writing appears to be in respect to Aud (Ayodhya) where Babur spent some days in 934 A.H. It reads as under :
"After spending several days pleasantly in that place where there are gardens, running waters, well-designed buildings, trees, particularly mango-trees, and various birds of coloured plumage, I ordered the march to be towards Ghazipur." (emphasis added) 1518. Pages 684 and 685, refer the dates 13th June 1529 A.D., 17th June 1529 A.D. and 20th June 1529 A.D., and say that Baqi joined Babur in pursuit of Biban and Bayazid near Dalmud (Dalmau) and Baqi was given leave along with his army of Aud (Ayodhya) on 20th June 1529 A.D. 1519. "John Layden and William Erskine's" book on "Babar/ Babur-Nama" also does not throw any light on this aspect.
1520. "Lieut.-Colonel F.G. Talbot" in his book "Memoirs of Baber Emperor of India-First of the Great Moghuls", first published in 1909 (first Indian reprint 1974 published by Ess Ess Publications, Delhi) has said that with an intent to set up an Empire in India, he set out on march in 1525 A.D. along with about 12 thousands men. On 29th December, 1525 A.D., he reached at Sialkot. Here he has given his experience with Jats and Gujers in the following words :
"Every time that I have entered Hindustan, the Jats and Gujers have regularly poured down in prodigious numbers, from their hills and wilds, in order to carry off oxen and buffaloes. These were the wretches that really inflicted the chief hardships, and were guilty of the severest oppressions on the country." (Page 174) 1521. Therefrom he proceeded to Panipat where he defeated Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi in April 1526 A.D. On page 187 to 188, Talbot has narrated Baber's memoirs after defeating Ibrahim Lodi as under :
"On Thursday, the 28th of Rejeb, about the hour of afternoon prayers, I entered Agra, and took up my residence at Sultan Ibrahim's palace. From the time when I conquered the country of Kabul, which was in the year 1504, till the present time I had always been bent on subduing Hindustan. Sometimes, however, from the misconduct of my Amirs and their dislike of the plan, sometimes from the cabals and opposition of my brothers, I was prevented from prosecuting any expedition into that country, and its provinces escaped being overrun. At length these obstacles were removed. There was now no one left, great or small, noble or private man, who could dare to utter a word in opposition to the enterprise. In the year 1519, I collected an army, and having taken the fort of Bajour by storm, put all the garrison to the sword. I next advanced into behreh, where I prevented all marauding and plunder, imposed a contribution on the inhabitants, and having levied it to the amount of four hundred thousand shahrukhis in money and goods, divided the proceeds among the troops who were in my service, and returned back to Kabul. From that time till the year 1526, I attached myself in a peculiar degree to the affairs of Hindustan, and in the space of these seven or eight years entered it five times at the head of an army. The fifth time, the Most High God, of his grace and mercy, cast down and defeated an enemy so mighty as Sultan Ibrahim, and made me the master and conqueror of the powerful empire of Hindustan."
1522. The Empire of Hindustan on Page 189 of Talbot's Memoirs of Baber (supra) is described in the following words :
"The empire of Hindustan is extensive, populous and rich. On the east, the south, and even the west, it is bounded by the Great Ocean. On the north, it has kabul, Ghazni, and Kandahar. The capital of all Hindustan is Delhi."
1523. He also narrated that on one hand Baber criticised the country he has recently invaded and conquered but simultaneously he has expressed very high opinion. Page 190 of the Book 'Memoirs of Baber' (supra) says:
"Hindustan is a country that has few pleasures to recommend it. The people are not handsome. They have no idea of the charms of friendly society, of frankly mixing together, or of familiar intercourse. They have no genius, no comprehension of mind, no politeness of manner, no kindness or fellow-feeling, no ingenuity or mechanical invention in planning or executing their handicraft works, no skill or knowledge in design or architecture; they have no good horses, no good flesh, no grapes or musk-melons, no good fruits, no ice or cold water, no good food or bread in their bazars, no baths or colleges, no candles, no torches, not even a candlestick.
The chief excellency of Hindustan is, that it is a large country, and has abundance of gold and silver. Another convenience of Hindustan is, that the workmen of every profession and trade are innumerable, and without end. For any work, or any employment, there is always a set ready, to whom the same employment and trade have descended from father to son for ages."
1524. Though it is not necessary for the present purpose to discuss Babur-nama at great length since we are not concerned with the history of Babur or his invasion to India, laying of empire here-at, and its other political, social and other consequences but in the light of the respective arguments advanced by the parties it may be of some importance to have a bird eye view of some incidental relevant aspects borne out from the description given in Babur-nama. Sri Mishra said that Babar was a thorough religious person. In fact the submission of Sri Misra that Babar was a deeply indulged religious man, had no hatred towards idols, never visited Ayodhya and, therefore, had no occasion to order for construction of any building/disputed building, i.e., mosque at Ayodhya, are duly concurred and in fact in the line of what has been argued by Sri Jilani and other counsels appearing for various Muslim parties.
This however is in direct contradiction to the arguments of Sri H.S.Jain, M.M. Pandey, A.K.Pandey etc. 1525. In Beveridge's Babur-Nama on page 15, the quality and habits of Babar are described:
"He was a true believer (Hanafi mazhablik) and pure in the Faith, not neglecting the Five Prayers and, his life through, making up his Omissions. He read the Quran very frequently and was a disciple of his Highness Khawaja 'Ubaidu'l-lah (Ahrari) who honoured him by visits and even called him son. His current readings were the two Quintets and the Masnawi of histories he read chiefly the Shah-nama. He had a poetic nature, but no taste for composing verses. He was so just that when he heard of a caravan returning from Khitai as overwhelmed by snow in the mountains of Eastern Andijan, and that of its thousand heads of houses (awiluq) two only had escaped, he sent his overseers to take charge of all goods and, though no heirs were near and though he was in want himself, summoned the heirs from Khurasan and Samarkand, and in the course of a year or two had made over to them all their property safe and sound.
He was very generous; in truth, his character rose altogether to the height of generosity. He was affable, eloquent and sweet-spoken, daring and bold. Twice out- distancing all his braves, he got to work with his own sword, once at the Gate of Akhsi, once at the Gate of Shahrukhiya. A middling archer, he was strong in the fist,- not a man but fell to his blow. Through his ambition, peace was exchanged often for war, friendliness for hostility.
In his early days he was a great drinker, later on used to have a party once or twice a week. He was good company, on occasions reciting verses admirably. Towards the last he rather preferred intoxicating confects and, under their sway, used to lose his head. His disposition was amorous, and he bore many a lover's mark. He played draughts a good deal, sometimes even threw the dice."
1526. The treasure, Baber received at Agra was distributed to his son Humayun and other relatives, army men and also sent to his relatives in Samarkand and Khurasan:
"(May 12th) On Saturday the 29th of Rajab the examinations and distribution of the treasure were begun. To Humayun were given 70 laks from the Treasury, and, over and above this, a treasure house was bestowed on him just as it was, without ascertaining and writing down its contents. To some begs 10 laks were given, 8, 7, or 6 to others. Suitable money-gifts were bestowed from the Treasury on the whole army, to every tribe there was, Afghan, Hazara, 'Arab, Biluch etc. to each according to its position. Every trader and student, indeed every man who had come with the army, took ample portion and share of bounteous gift and largess. To those not with the army went a mass of treasure in gift and largess, as for instance, 17 laks to Kamran, 15 laks to Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza, while to 'Askari, Hindal and indeed to the whole various train of relations and younger children went masses of red and white (gold and silver), of plenishing, jewels and slaves. Many gifts went to the begs and soldiery on that side (Tramontana). Valuable gifts (saughat) were sent for the various relations in Samarkand, Khurasan, Kashghar and 'Iraq. To holy men belonging to Samarkand and Khurasan went offerings vowed to God (nuzur); so too to Makka and Madina. We gave one Shahrukhi for every soul in the country of Kabul and the valley-side of Varsak, man and woman, bond and free, of age or non-age."
1527. The revenue of the country held by Babar in 1528 A.D. from Bhira to Bihar was 52 krurs (judged by Erskine in 1854 A.D. at about Pound 4,212,000).
1528. At the time Babar invaded India, it was governed by five Musalman Rulers and two Pagans which he described as respected and independent Rulers. Besides them, there were many Rais and Rajas in the hills and jungles, held in little esteem. The seven Principle Rulers are described on page 481 to 484 of Babur-Nama by Beveridge:
"At the date of my conquest of Hindustan it was governed by five Musalman rulers (padshah) and two Pagans (kafir). These were the respected and independent rulers, but there were also, in the hills and jungles, many rais and rajas, held in little esteem (kichik karim).
First, there were the Afghans who had possession of Dihli, the capital, and held the country from Bhira to Bihar. Junpur, before their time, had been in possession of Sl. Husain Sharqi (Eastern) whose dynasty Hindustanis call Purabi (Eastern). His ancestors will have been cup- bearers in the presence of Sl. Firuz Shah and those (Tughluq) sultans :they became supreme in Junpur after his death. At that time Dihli was in the hands of Sl. 'Alau'u'-din (Alam Khan) of the Sayyid Dynasty to whose ancestor Timur Beg had given it when, after having captured it, he went away. Sl. Buhlul Lodi and his son (Sikandar) got possession of the capital Junpur and the capital Dihli, and brought both under one government (88I AH.--1476 AD).
Secondly, there was Sl. Muhammad Muzaffer in Gujrat; he departed from the world a few days before the defeat of Sl. Ibrahim. He was skilled in the Law, a ruler (padshah) seeking after knowledge, and a constant copyist of the Holy Book. His dynasty people call Tank. His ancestors also will have been wine-servers to Sl. Firuz Shah and those (Tughluq) sultans; they became possessed of Gujrat after his death.
Thirdly, there were the Bahmanis of the Dakkan (Deccan, i.e., South), but at the present time no independent authority is left them; their great begs have laid hands on the whole country, and must be asked for whatever is needed.
Fourthly, there was Sl. Mahmud in the country of Malwa, which people call also Mandau. His dynasty they call Khilij (Truk). Rana Sanga had defeated Sl. Mahmud and taken possession of most of his country. This dynasty also has become feeble. Sl. Mahmud's ancestors also must have been cherished by Sl Firuz Shah; they became possessed of the Malwa country after his death.
Fifthly, there was Nasrat Shah in the country of Bengal. His father (Husain Shah), a Sayyid styled 'Alau'u'd-din, had ruled in Bengal and Nasrat Shah attained to rule by inheritance. A surprising custom in Bengal is that hereditary succession is rare. The royal office is permanent and there are permanent offices of amirs, wazirs and mansab-dars (officials). It is the office that Bengalis regard with respect. Attached to each office is a body of obedient, subordinate retainers and servants. If the royal heart demand that a person should be dismissed and another be appointed to sit in his place, the whole body of subordinates attached to that office become the (new) officeholder's. There is indeed this peculiarity of the royal office itself that any person who kills the ruler (padshah) and seats himself on the throne, becomes ruler himself;
amirs, wazirs, soldiers and peasants submit to him at once, obey him, and recognize him for the rightful ruler his predecessor in office had been. Bengalis say, "We are faithful to the throne; we loyally obey whoever occupies it". As for instance, before the reign of Nasrat Shah's father 'Alau'u'd-din, an Abyssinian (Habshi, named Muzaffar Shah) had killed his sovereign (Mahmud Shah Ilyas), mounted the throne and ruled for some time. 'Alau'u'd-din killed that Abyssinian, seated himself on the throne and became ruler. When he died, his son (Nasrat) became ruler by inheritance. Another Bengali custom is to regard it as a disgraceful fault in a new ruler if he expend and consume the treasure of his predecessors. On coming to rule he must gather treasure of his own. To amass treasure Bengalis regard as glorious distinction. Another custom in Bengal is that from ancient times parganas have been assigned to meet the charges of the treasury, stables, and all royals expenditure and to defray these charges no impost is laid on other lands.
These five, mentioned above, were the great Musalman rulers, honoured in Hindustan, many-legioned, and broad-landed. Of the Pagans the greater both in territory and army, is the Raja of Bijanagar.
The second is Rana Sanga who in these latter days had grown great by his own valour ans sword. His original country was Chitur; in the downfall from power of the Mandaus Sultans, he became possessed of many of their dependencies such as Rantanbur, Sarangpur, Bhilsan and Chandiri. Chandiri I stormed in 934 AH. (1528 A.D.) and, by God's pleasure, took it in a few hours; in it was Rana Sanga's great and trusted man Midni Rao; we made general massacre of the Pagans in it and, as will be narrated, converted what for many years had been a mansion of hostility, into a mansion of Islam.
There are very many rais and rajas on all sides and quarters of Hindustan, some obedient to Islam, some, because of their remoteness or because their places are fastnesses, not subject to Musalman rule." 1529. From the above it does appear that Babar's visit to India for its conquest was a well intended plan and fulfillment of a dream which he had. At page 478 Mrs. Beveridge has written:
"From the date 910 at which the country of Kabul was conquered, down to now (932 AH.) (my) desire for Hindustan had been constant, but owing sometimes to the feeble counsels of begs, sometimes to the non accompaniment of elder and younger brethren, a move on Hindustan had not been practicable and its territories had remained unsubdued. At length no such obstacles were left; no beg, great or small (beg begat) of lower birth, could speak an opposing word. In 925 AH. (1519 AD.) we led an army out and, after taking Bajaur by storm in 2-3 gari (44-
66 minutes), and making a general massacre of its people, went on into Bhira. Bhira we neither over-ran nor plundered; we imposed a ransom on its people, taking from them in money and goods to the value of 4 laks of shahrukhis and having shared this out to the army and auxiliaries, returned to Kabul. From then till now we laboriously held tight to Hindustan, five times leading an army into it. The fifth-time, God the Most High, by his own mercy and favour, made such a foe as Sl. Ibrahim the vanquished and loser, such a realm as Hindustan our conquest and possession." (emphasis added) 1530. It also appears therefrom that Babur treated himself to be the third invader who have conquered and ruled Hindustan. First according to him was Mahmud of Ghazni (also called Mahmud Ghaznavi), a "Turk" by race, who invaded India on several occasions and though died in 1030 AD but his descendants set long on the seat of Government in Hindustan. The second was Shihabuddin of Ghur (also known as "Muhammad Ghori") who died in 1206 AD and then the third was Babur.
1531. It thus appear that Babur did not came to Hindustan with an intention to spread Islam religion but he had intention to conquer and rule the country. It is true that Hindustan in the present form under a single hand could not have been there in 1526 AD and on the contrary it was independently ruled by several Rulers treating each part as a country but as a whole also it used to be called by Babar as "Hindustan". This is also evident from page 479 of the aforesaid book where it is mentioned:
"All Hindustan was not under one supreme head (padshah), but each Raja ruled independently in his own country."
1532. It thus cannot be doubted that most of the persons, who ruled Indian sub-continent at that time were followers of Islam with whom Baber fought to set up his empire. 1533. About the construction of buildings in general and the workmen for construction work, on page 520 of "Babur- Nama" by Beveridge, she said:
"Another good thing in Hindustan is that it has unnumbered and endless workmen of every kind. There is a fixed caste (jam'i) for every sort of work and for every thing, which has done that work or that thing from father to son till now. Mulla Sharaf, writing in the Zafar-nama about the building of Timur Beg's Stone Mosque, lays stress on the fact that on it 200 stone-cutters worked, from Azarbaijan, Fars, Hindustan and other countries. But 680 men worked daily on my buildings in Agra and of Agra stone-cutters only; while 1491 stone-cutters worked daily on my buildings in Agra, Sikri, Biana, Dulpur, Gualiar and Kuil. In the same way there are numberless artisans and workmen of every sort in Hindustan."
1534. There is mention of buildings in Babur-Nama at different places including temple of Gwalior, mosque at Delhi, Agra, Gwalior and other several places but it is true that neither there is mention of demolition of any religious place by Babar in Awadh area nor there is anything to show that he either entered Ayodhya or had occasion to issue any direction for construction of a building and in particular a Mosque at Ayodhya. 1535. The Babar's camping at Ghaghar has also been described by William Erskine in his book "History of India under Baber" (May 1845), though published for the first time in 1854 after his death (Book No. 65) (Published in 1994 by M/s Atlantic Publishers and Distributors). Erskine came to India in 1803 AD as Secretary of Sri James Mackintosh at Bombay and later came to be appointed as Master in equity in the Recorder of Bombay Court but had to leave India in 1823 on suspicion of embezzlement. He was born in 1773 and died in 1852. After return from India he spent rest of his life in Scotland occupying the post of Provost of Saint Andrews in 1837-38 AD. It says:
"Baber, having brought the war of Chanderi to a conclusion, lost no time in marching to meet the danger that threatened him in the East. Having repassed the Jamna, he proceeded without intermission towards Kanauj. On the road, he learned that his suspicions of Sheikh Bayezid's fidelity had not been unfounded. That chief had joined Baban and Maaruf, the leaders of the revolt, with his whole army; so that Baber's troops had been compelled to retreat across the Ganges, to evacuate even Kanauj and to fall back on Raberi, movements that had enabled the enemy to take Shemsabad, a rich town in the Doab, by storm."
1536. In "History of India under Baber" by William Erskine (Supra) on page 87, there is a footnote showing that Mir or Mirza was a title:
"The princes of Taimur's family, even those who held the supreme power, had not yet assumed the title of shah or padshah, king of emperor; they were called Mir or Mirza, and often Sultan. In the text, however, the ruling prince is often called King, for distinction's sake; following the usage of historians in general, and even of Baber himself. The title of Sultan was not confined to the sovereign, many chiefs, and children of chiefs, especially among the Moghul tribes, being called by that name, which is an Arabic term, nearly equivalent to Lord. The titles, Mir, Mirza, and Shah, came also, in process of time, to be very commonly given to religious guides and holy men, or mendicants, and, from a sort of flattery, were often continued to the descendants as part of the family name. The title of Mirza, in later times, has been lavished by common usage on secretaries and clerks; and in general on all who pretend to learning. Mirza is merely mirzadeh, son of a Mir."
1537. The reference of Oudh in the said book of Earskine is on page 406, 443 and 450. Referring Lodhi dynasties expansions on page 406-407 Easrskine has written:
"Behlul's son, Sultan Sekander Lodi, a prince of talent, in a reign of thirty years, enlarged the kingdom still farther. In the Est, he subdued Behar, the last province that remained in the possession of the Sherki kings; and even advanced into Bengal, where Sultan Husein Shah had taken refuge. By a convention concluded with Sultan Ala- ed-din of Bengal, it was agreed, that Sekander should retain Behar, Tirhut, Sirkar Saran, and all that he had conquered; that he should not again invade Bengal; and that neither prince should support the enemies of the other. On the west, he gained possession of Dhulpur and Chanderi, and received the submission of the Raja of Gualiar and and other princes; so that, at his death, his kingdom had attained a very great extent, containing the Penjab, the Doab, the provinces of Oud, Laknau, Juanpur and Behar, besides a wide tract of country to the west of the Jamna, from the Satlej to Bandelkand. These extensive possessions, however, though under one king, had no very strong principle of cohesion. The monarchy was a congeries of nearly independent principalities, jagirs and provinces, each ruled by a hereditary chief, or by a zemindar or delegate from Delhi; and the inhabitants looked more to their immediate governors, who had absolute power in the province, and in whose hands, consequently, lay their happiness or misery, than to a distant and little known sovereign. It was the individual, not the law, that reigned. The Lodi princes, not merely to strengthen their own power, but from necessity, had in general committed the government of the province, and the chief offices of trust, to their own countrymen, the Afghans; so that men of the Lodi, Fermuli, and Lohana tribes, held all the principal jagirs; which, from the habitual modes of thinking of their race, they considered as their own of right, and purchased by their swords, rather than as due to any bounty or liberality on the part of the sovereign."
1538. Again on page 441-443 while referring political condition of the area under rule of Ebrahim Lodhi who was defeated by Babar in April 1526 AD, Earskine has said (including the description of political sovereignty on Ayodhya):
"But, though Baber had been victorious in the field, and was in possession of the two great capitals of the kingdom, it soon appeared that his situation, far from being one of safety or ease, was surrounded with difficulty and danger. He and his army were strangers to the people whom he had subdued; and a mutual dislike soon manifested itself between his soldiers and the inhabitants of Agra, his head-quarters. The peasantry, as well as the fighting men of the country, shunned and fled from his followers. The north of India, at the time of Baber's conquest, still retained much of its original Hindu organization; its system of village and district administration and government; its division into numerous little chieftainships, or petty local governments; and, in political revolutions, the people looked much more to their own immediate rulers, than to the prince who governed in the capital. Except at Delhi and Agra, the inhabitants everywhere fortified their towns, and prepared to resist.
The invasion was regarded as a temporary inundation, that would speedily pass off. Every man in authority raised troops, and put himself in a condition to act. Those who held delegated authority or jagirs, being generally Afghans, were consequently hostile to the new state of things. They soon came to an understanding among themselves, and took measures for mutual co-operation. Raja Hasan Khan of Mewat, in the neighborhood of Agra, was the grand instigator of the opposition; which was supported by Nizam Khan, in Biana; Muhammed Zeitun, in Dhulpur; Tatar Khan Sarang-Khani, in Gualiar; Husein Khan Lohani, in Raberi; Kutb Khan, in Etawa; Alim Khna Jilal Khan Jighat, in Kalpi; Kasim Sambhali, in Sambhal; and Marghub, a slave, in Mahawan, within twenty kos of Agra. Indeed, all of these chiefs were immediately around Agra, or close upon its borders. They looked for aid from Rana Sanga, the powerful chief of Cheitur; who, on his part, laid claim to a great part of the right bank of the Jamna. These Western Afghans wished to place Sultan Mahmud Lodi, a Brother of the late Sultan Ibrahim, on the throne of Delhi; and so to preserve the Afghan and the Lodi dynasty.
In the Eastern provinces of Juanpur and Oud, the opposition presented even a more regular form. There, the confederacy of Afghan chiefs, who had been in open rebellion against Ibrahim for two years before his death, still continued. The revolt was originally headed by Nasir Khan Lohani, Maaruf Fermuli, and others. The insurgents, we have seen, had elected Baber Khan Lohani, the son of Deria Khan of Behar, for their king; and proclaimed him, under the name of Sultan Muhamed Shah. They now possessed, not only Behar, but nearly the whole territories of the old Sherki monarchy, especially the country on the left bank of the Ganges; and had even crossed to the right bank of the river, and taken possession of Kanauj, and advanced into the Doab. Sultan Ibrahim had sent an army, under Mustafa Fermuli and Firuz Khan Sarang-khani, to reduce the rebels to obedience. Mustafa had met the revolted chiefs, and defeated them in some well-contested actions. On his death, which occurred some time before the defeat of Sultan Ibrahim, he was succeeded in the command by Sheikh Bayezid, his younger brother. The army under his orders was formidable; and it was naturally to be expected, that, changed as circumstances now were, the two armies opposed to each other in the field, being both Afghans, would lay aside their mutual animosities, and, animated by national feelings, unite to expel Baber, the common enemy."
1539. The Afghan Chiefs who rule in various territories of India without any subordination, when realized that the Babar may settle in India ending their unlimited authority, their further action is described at page 443/444:
"It was clear that the Afghan chiefs, who till now had ruled with nearly unlimited authority both in Delhi and Behar, must be ruined if Baber settled in Hindustan, They, therefore, stirred up, with great success, the apprehensions of the natives, whether Musulman or Hindu, by the most false and groundless reports. The people of the country were told, that they had every thing to dread from their barbarous invaders; that they would be robbed of their property; that their wives and children would be dishonoured; their temples profaned or destroyed. Baber and his army had reached Agra in May, in that climate the hottest season of the year. The inhabitants, in terror, fled before them, and abandoned their dwellings, so that no grain or provender could be procured for man or beast. The villagers fled to the waste, and infested the highways, plundering and robbing on every side. The roads became impassable. Baber's force was so small that he was unable to send out detachments sufficient to protect the different districts. To add to these difficulties, the heats that year happened to be uncommonly intense, so that many of his men, who were from more temperate climates, unaccustomed to the burning sun of India, dropped down and died on the spot."
1540. However, the manner in which the Babar manage the things has been said on page 446 showing that Awadh was assigned to Bayazid Fermuli. To take possession of the assigned territory, Humayun moved alongwith army and on page 450 it has mentioned:
"Humayun, after putting to fight the Afghan army, crossed the Ganges and took possession of Juanpur. He next marched to Ghazipur, intending to attack Nasir Khan's army, which had retired into that neighborhood. But the Afghans, on his approach, retired behind the Gogra, as it would appear, into the territory of Bengal; and a detachment that he sent to pursue them returned, after plundering the country of Kherid and Behar. Having thus expelled them from the Juanpur territory, he left Shah Mir Husein, in the city of Juanpur, supported by Sultan Juneid Birlas with some of his best troops; and Sheikh Bayezid in Oud, with every means of maintaining the country; and then, in compliance with orders which he received from his father, recrossed into the Doab; and marching back by Kalpi, of which he gained possession by the submission of Alim Khan, rejoined the Emperor at Agra, bringing Alim Khan along with him."
1541. The movement of Babar in the last week of March 1528 AD near Awadh is described on page 487:
"The Emperor sending Sultan Chin Taimur, with a strong force to pursue them, himself advanced and occupied Laknau on the 21st, and passed the Gumti. Moving again in pursuit of the retreating enemy, he encamped, on the 28th, four or five miles above Oud, at the junction of the Gogra and Sirwu. Till then, Sheikh Bayazid had maintained his ground beyond the Sirwu, and had prevented Sultan Chin Taimur, Baber's general, from crossing. Being now reinforced, however, Chin Taimur effected a passage, and found the Afghans in full retreat. He followed them with great alacrity, slew numbers of them, and dispersed their army. Sheikh Bayezid threw himself into a jungle and escaped. Chin Taimur, after a pursuit of sixty miles, reached a spot which the families of the fugitives had left but a short time before. The light force was now divided into several parties, who followed the flying enemy in different directions. Their baggage and families were overtaken and seized; and several Afghans brought in as prisoners. The success was complete."
1542. Here also there is no mention of anyone as Mir Baqi or about entry of Babar in Awadh. It was submitted that there was no occasion for Babar either to demolish a temple or to construct a mosque at Ayodhya in 1528 AD.
1543. On page 443, he has described the state of affairs at Ayodhya in 1526 that the Afghan Chief at Oud revolted against Ibrahim Lodi about two years back his death and the revolt was originally headed by Nasir Khan Lohani, Maaruf Fermuli and others. After the death of Mustafa Fermuli, Sheikh Bayezid succeeded him in his command who was his younger brother. 1544. On page 450, he mentions that Humayun after taking possession of Jaunpur left Shah Mir Husein thereat supported by Sultan Juneid Birlas along with some of his best troops and Sheikh Bayezid in Oud along with every means of maintaining the country and thereafter crossed Doab and marched towards Kalpi of which he gained possession after surrender of Alim Khan and immediately thereafter he rejoined the Emperor at Agra. In 1527, Babar proceeded on his march to fight against Rajputs where he defeated Rana Sanga. This victory has been described on page 473, Erskine's History of India (supra) as under :
"No victory could be more complete. The enemy were quite broken and dispersed. The whole fields around were strewed with the dead, as well as the roads to Biana and Alwar. Among the slain were Hasan Khan Mewati, who fell by a matchlock shot; Raul Udi Singh, of Dongerpur; Rai Chanderbhan Chohan; Manikchand Chohan, and many other chiefs of note. Baber directed a tower of heads to be erected; on a rising ground near the camp; and henceforth assumed the proud title of Ghazi, Victorious in a Holy War.
Rana Sanga himself escaped; it is said by the devotion of some of his followers, who threw themselves in the way of the pursuers, and sacrificed their lives for his safety; and the regret expressed by Baber for not having urged the pursuit in person has reference probably to the escape of his illustrious rival. It is remarkable that, since this defeat of Rana Sanga, no Rana of Cheitur has ever taken the field in person against any of the princes of the House of Taimur. When these princes were along with their armies, the Rana's troops have been entrusted to some eminent Rajput chief, the Rana himself withdrawing to some one of the hill-forts of his country."
1545. Baber returned to Agra on 25th April, 1527 and, thereafter, gained Chandwar, Raberi and Etawa which were surrendered by Kutb Khan who held it. The victory of Babar within a year after defeat of Ibrahim Lodi against Rajputs and others has been described on page 477 of Erskine's History of India (supra) as under :
"That battle has broken the power of the Afghans in India, as that of Kanwa had since broken that of the Hindu confederacy. He had evinced, to every class of men in the country, the decided superiority of his arms; and, with his mental resources, the awe inspired by his hardly northern troops, and his own bravery and conduct, the conquest of every part of India seems to lie open to his arms."
1546. Baber took some rest as mentioned on page 478 of Erskine's History of India:
"During the rains he visited Sikri, Dhulpur, and Bari, proceeding as far as the Chambal; he thence returned to Agra; and went to Kol or Koel in the Doad, and on to Sambhal, beyond the Ganges, returning by a different route."
1547. He, thereafter, planned to march against Afghans of the East, who still held out, in considerable force, beyond the Ganges and in Behar and some of the Hindu chiefs in the West whose confederacy he had felt to be so formidable, i.e. Medini Rai of Chanderi. After defeating Medini Rai at Chanderi, he proceeded to East, i.e., Kanauj. On page 484, Erskine's History of India, it is said that the Baber got information that his suspicion of Sheikh Bayezid's fidelity are not unfounded. Bayezid had joined Baban and Maaruf, the leaders of the revolt with his whole army. As we have already noticed Sheikh Bayezid was posted at Oudh by Humayun to look after that area but on joining revolt, Baber had to move to Oudh. He reached near Ayodhya (Oudh) on 28th March 1528 A.D. and has narrated the events which took place thereafter as under :
"The light force was now divided into several parties, who followed the flying enemy in different directions. Their baggage and families were overtaken and seized; and several Afghans brought in as prisoners. The success was complete."
1548. Here also we do not find anything so suggest that Baber either entered Ayodhya or gave direction to anyone to construct a Mosque or to demolish a temple so as to construct a mosque.
1549. Lastly, we have Hindi Translation, i.e. "Mughal Kaleen Bharat Baber (1526-1530)" by Sayed Athar Abbas Rizvi (Supra). In the chapter titled as "Review" Rizvi has observed that due to lack of confidence on Afghans, Baber already separated them from his army except a few one of confidence. Commenting on construction activities and available revenue on page 44, Chapter "Review", Rizvi has said:

Rizvi has also not found Babar's entry in Ayodhya or construction of a mosque or direction to anyone including Mir Baqi for construction of any building at Ayodhya.
1554. Some of the authors have appreciated the character of Babar depicting him a holy, religious, kind hearted brave man having respect for all the religions etc. This is placed before us to deny even a possibility that Babar could have ordered to construct a mosque in a religious place of others.
1555. Dr. Radhey Shyam in his book "Babar" (supra) on page 441 has observed that Babar was what his fortune and misfortune, man and environment, his foes and friends, his joys and sorrows had made him. He was a soldier, a born warrior, a seasoned statesman and an accomplished diplomat, a loving husband and a man of many virtues seldom to be found in one single individual. Dr. Radhey Shyam thereafter referred to the comments of Abul Fazl about the qualities of Babar, describing him as "bakht buland, himmat arjumand, Qudarat Kishwar kushai, mulkdai, Koshish dar mamulai balad, Sarfi niyat bar Rifayat abad, Khushdil wakhtan sipahi, zabt ashar az tabahi (Akbar Nama)". This appreciation by Abul Fazl is understandable since he had to show great regards to the grandfather of the Emperor in whose regime, he was employed. 1556. Dr. Radhey Shyam has further referred to the comments of Nizamuddin Ahmad (Tabqat-i-Akbari), translation II, page 40, Mirza Haidar Doghlat, the author of Tarikh-i- Rashidi. Dr. Radhey Shyam proceeded to characterise Babar as charitable, benevolent, liberal, kind, just, adjustable temperament, robust vigour and dynamic personality. On page 443 Dr. Radhey Shyam said that "he was deeply imbued with humen feelings." On page 444 Dr. Radhey Shyam said that "he followed his religion like a comman man without allowing it to prejudice his mind against the followers of other religions. Even after the conquest of Hindustan he continued to maintain such an attitude." On page 447 he observed that "he never worked under the influence of religion. . . . . . To him Shias and Sunnis were all alike."
1557. We would not like to make any comment on the above observations as if we are sitting in appeal over the work of learned author but suffice it to mention that the learned author has ignored what is contained on page 554-555 of Beveridge's Baburnama (supra) where the breaking of the wine couplets in pieces has been compared with the dashing of the God of the idolaters. To the same effect is what has been translated by Rizvi (supra) also.
1558. Besides, we may refer at this stage the own observations of Dr. Radhey Shyam on page 451 of the book:
"As regards the destruction of the HIndu temples there is historical evidence both in Babar's support and against him. During the course of his campaigns or pleasure trips Babar occasionally came across large number of Hindu temples. These temples provoked great interest in him. Some of them he visited and appreciated their architectural beauty. While at Gwalior in 1528 Babar visited the fort, wherein he saw the places of Raja Man Singh and Vikramaditya. On the west of Rahim Dad's garden he saw a "Lofty idol house." This was famous Teli Mandir which is said to have been constructed by Raja Man Singh's Gujari wife Mrignaini. Then in the Urwa valley he saw the idol statues and he writes, "three sides of the Urwa valley are solid rock, not the red rock of Bayana but one paler in colour. On these sides people have cut out idol - statues, large and small. One large on the south side being perhaps 20 qari (yards) high. These idols are shewn quite naked without covering for the privaties, " writes that, "we rode ....to visit the idol- houses of Gualiar. Some are two, and some are three storeys high, each storey rather low, in the ancient fashion. On their stone plainths are sculptured images.
Some idol-houses in College fashion, have portico, large high cupola. In the lower celles are idols carved in the rock. Except in the case of Jain idols in the Urwa valley, Babar never gave orders for the destruction of the temple of other places. As regards the Jain statutes of the Urwa Valley he himself has mentioned, in his Memoirs that the, "naked idols are its defect, I for my part ordered them to be destroyed." It is rather doubtful whether this order was ever carried out. Mrs. Beveridge in a brief note writes that, "they were already in a mutilated conditions and they continue to be so until the Jains repaired them with coloured plaster." (emphasis added) 1559. Thereafter, he has considered an inscription found at Jami Masjid at Sambhal (in the State of U.P.), which is said to have been constructed by demolishing Hari Mandir out of the debris of that temple:
"It is related that at his orders famous Hari Mandir at Sambhal was demolished and a Jami mosque was constructed out of the debris of that temple by his famous general Hindu Beg. An inscription on one of the walls of the mosque reads :
        ‫رافع الویہ ملک وملل‬                    ‫جامع اش ٔیم فضل و کمال‬       ۱
        ‫باقی انبیہ علم وعمل‬                    ‫باسط اجنحہ امن و امان‬        ۲
        ‫حفظ الّلہ عزو جل‬                       ‫شاہ جم جاہ محمد بابر‬
        ‫روشن از پر تو ٓان شد سنبل‬              ‫ شمع دولت چوبرافروخت بہند‬۳
        ‫کہ مصون بادزنقصان وخلل‬                 ‫از پے ساختن ایں مسجد‬     ۴
        ‫کہ بود عمدہ ارکان و دل‬                  ‫کرد فرمان بکمیں بندہ خویش‬
        ‫آں باخلق نکو گشتہ مثل‬                  ‫میر با عقل و خردہندو بیگ‬     ۵
        ‫یافت اتمام بہ توفیق ازل‬                ‫چوں زفرمان شہنشاہ جہاں‬       ۶
        ‫یکم از شہر ربیع الول‬             ‫سال تاریخ و مہ دوزش گشتہ‬
                           "Translation by author"
The Collector of the buildings of grace and beauty the raiser of the standards of rule and faith, the spreader of the wings of peace and tranquillity, the builder of the buildings of knowledge and deed, Muhammad Babar, a Jam in dignity--May God Almighty have him in His protection, Kindled in India the lamp of power, when a ray of it fell upon Sambhal, To build this mosque may it be protected from destruction and decay, He gave orders to his mean slave, who is one of the principal officers, Mir Hindu Beg, the intelligent and wise who is an example to others in polite manners, And when in consequence of the order of the sovereign of the world by guidance of Providence to the mosque was completed."
1560. Its date is first day of the month of Rabi L 933 H. (December 1526 A.D.) 1561. Dr. Radhey Shyam, however, has then doubted correctness of the contents of the said inscription on pages 454- 457:
"This inscription clearly mentions that at Babar's orders the mosque was built and completed on the first day of the month of Rabi-ul-Awwal 933 H./6th December 1526 by Hindu Beg. But it is quite surprising that Babar who was quite festidious in mentioning about everything that concerned him or even others, has not mentioned about the construction of a mosque by Hindu Beg at Sambhal. Nor did he mention that he gave orders to Hindu Beg to demolish any Hindu temple and construct a mosque over it. There is no reference to any order for the destruction of a Hindu temple and construction of a mosque by Hindu Beg at Sambhal in his Memoirs. Babar visited Sambhal in Sept.-Oct. 1527 and stayed there for three days but in his Memoirs he does not say a word about the fanatical activities of Hindu Beg there. His annoyance at the destruction of the Hindu temple by Hindu Beg at Sambhal is reflected in his silence and his indifference towards the whole affair. During the years 1526-27 his position in Hindustan was so precarious that it was not possible for him to take any drastic action against any general, Hindu Beg being one of them; even though they might have continued to commit gruesome acts in the name of their master. However, it is definite that though Babar's name was associated with the construction of the mosque, as was the prevailing practice, the Hindu temple was not demolished at his orders. Hindu Beg might have demolished the temple on his own account and even did not care to refer this matter to his master.
Nevertheless, the whole affair has aroused controversy. Mr. Carlleyele is of the opinion that the Jami mosque which is still standing amidst the beautiful surrounding was not constructed by Hindu Beg and it is of much earlier period. The district Gazetteer of United Provinces (Moradabad) mentions that "Babar's inscription in the mosque is a great historical forgery of all times." And the account of the temple and the mosque given in it is as follows: 'The erection of Hari Mandir is variously ascribed to Prithviraj, to a Raja named Jagat Singh and one Nar Singh, the grandson of Raja Vikram Sen one of the Dors of Baran. This temple no longer exists and its place is taken by a striking mosque, which forms the conspicuous feature in the landscape for miles around. This building is mainly of stone, which is certainly the material employed for the great central dome, for the outer walls and porch and for the flooring of the broad courtyard." In 1874 Mr. Carlleyele visited and inspected the mosque and was convinced that the dome was of Hindu workmanship, but the bricks were of Musalman workmanship. The whole of the mosque is coated with plaster so that it is impossible to ascertain the material. The wings are divided by a lateral row of pillars into two aisels and each had three arched openings on the courtyard. A flight of stone steps on either side gives access to the roof of the mosque, from which fine view of the town and the surrounding country can be obtained. Mr. Carlleyele came to the conclusion that the conversion of the temple into a mosque was of very recent date. He based his decision on the fact that there has been recent litigation on the subject of the site between the Musalmans and Hindus and appears to have been influenced by the arguments of the latter to the effect that the old inscriptions on the mosque walls were impudent forgeries. This claim of the Hindus was of course rejected in the civil courts. Mr. Carlleyele could not see the documents going back to the days of Jahangir, now in possession of the guardians of the mosque. General Cunningham has repudiated the suggestion that the inscription were not genuine. The most important of these, states that the mosque was built by Hindu Beg at the orders of Babar in December 1526. It is certainly curious that the temple should have remained till that date, for Sambhal had long been the seat of the Muslim government, and it is even more surprising that a noted inconoclast like Sikandar Lodi should have allowed a building of such sanctity to stand in his temporary capital. . . . . . But the mosque at Sambhal might well be older than Babar, to judge from its appearance. The architecture resembles that of Pathan buildings such as great mosque of Badaon and the huge sloping bastions on the west. The whole structure is very plain, severe, and massive, and if the Hindu materials have been employed the ornamentation has been very effectively concealed, since the only traces of Hindu covering visible are two rosettes on the stone slabs of the steps leading from the eastern gateway to the quadrangle. In the middle of the latter is a tank and fountain, filled from a large well outside the gateway. Whether Babar built it or simply repaired the mosque cannot be positively stated, but it is curious that the Ain-i-Akbari has referred to the celebrated temple of Vishnu at Sambhal. An inscription in the south wing states that Rustam Khan Deccani repaired the mosque in 1657, while a similar tablet in the north wing was erected by one Sayyid Qutb in 1626. The two inscriptions above the outer and inner arches of the central chamber record the restorations affected by the Musalmans of the town and district about 1845." Thus Carlleyele's report asserts that Jami Masjid of Sambhal is of earlier date (ii) the inscription is fake (iii) that it was constructed much later.
But the arguments given against the construction of the mosque by Hindu Beg are not tenable. Had the mosque been of earlier date there should have been an inscription on it bearing the date of its construction. The grounds on which the inscription which assigns the construction of the mosque to Hindu Beg, has been declared fake, have not been indicated. Then the report itself records that in the mosque at places the use of the debris of a Hindu temple is visible. In addition to it may also be observed that ever since the occupation of Sambhal by the Mughals in December 1526 or a little earlier till the date when it was conferred on Humayun in jagir, the position of the Mughals there had always been very precarious. This is borne out by the fact that after its occupation Ali Yusuf was appointed to hold its charge. After his death Abdullah Kitabdar was sent and thereafter Hindu Beg and both of them returned to Agra after a few days and waited on Babar. Why did they return from there without being summoned to emperor's presence? Babar does not mention the reason which forced them to return from Sambhal. Nor does any other authority. It can however be presumed that the Hindu population which was so hostile to Hindu Beg did not permit him to stay there any longer and to continue to display the zeal of a fanatic. Nor did Babar like to send him again to Sambhal. Even if it is conceded that the mosque is of the earlier date, it can be presumed that its repair by Hindu Beg was not liked by the Hindu population." 1562. In the subsequent part Dr. Radhey Shyam proceeded to consider Ayodhya dispute also as a parrelel to the Sambhal's building.
1563. But if we consider what has been writeen in Babarnama by the Babar in straight words without twisting or mincing them we find that like any other brave, couragious, tactful but brutal warrior, Babar also possess all these qualities. It is true that he was truly religious but it means that he was a complete Islamic person and lacked tolerance atleast to the idol worshippers. He had no hitch in destroying idols worshipped by the inhabitants of India at that time and this we find very visibly from the words which are translated by Mrs. Beveridge from Babar's manuscript of "Tuzuk-i-babri" as is evident from page 554-555 as under:
"And I made public the resolution to abstain from wife, which had been hidden in the treasury of my breast.
The victorious servants, in accordance with the illustratious order, dashed upon the earth of contempt and destruction the flagons and the cups, and the other utensils in gold and silver, which in their number and their brilliance were like the stars of the firmament. They dashed them in pieces, as, God willing! soon will be dashed the gods of the idolaters,--and they distributed the fragments among the poor and needy." (emphasis added) 1564. In respect to the inhabitants of Hindustan, at page 518 of the aforesaid book it says as under:
"Most of the inhabitants of Hindustan are pagans; they call a pagan a Hindu. Most Hindus believe in the transmigration of souls. All artisans, wage-earners, and officials are Hindus. In our countries dwellers in the wilds (i.e. nomads) get tribal names."
1565. Like other invaders whenever he defeated the local Rulers, his army did all such acts of loot, general massacre etc. While conquering Sambhal on page 528 the act of the army of Babur is mentioned as under:
"Malik Qasim cut off the heads of part of his force, took many horses, a few elephants and mass of booty." 1566. After defeating Rana Sanga and his other supporters, at page 576 of the Babarnama by Beveridge it is mentioned that as a trophy of victory an order was given to set up a pillar of pagan heads on the infact-hill (koh-Bacha) between which and his camp the battle had been fought.
1567. Similarly, on page 587 of the aforesaid book on 27th September, 1527 AD he mentions:
"Humayun had left Darwish (-i-ali) and Yusuf-i-ali in Sambal; they crossed one river, fought Qutb Sirwani and a party of rajas, beat them well and killed a mass of men.
They sent a few heads and an elephant into Kul while we were there." (emphasis added) 1568. Though in the army of Babur Hindustani soldiers were also included but it appears that he did not repose much confidence therein as is evident from page 547 of the aforesaid book:
"As little confidence was placed in Hindustani people------------"
1569. As an invader Babar entered the Indian subcontinent, conquered it and did what he could or found necessary to claim victory which nobody can comment atleast today. It is said that all is fair in love and war and laws of war are not set by pen since they are decided in a war field by those who are fighting or by their commanders. Discussion may be held as to whether the manner in which a war took place, fought and the action of the soldiers therein was justified or not but the fact remains that before the matter has been taken in 20th Century by various countries to lay down certain principles to be observed during war and also recognise certain rights of prisoners of war, prior thereto no such principle in general were observed by the Rulers of different countries though at local level some kind of practice with respect to time etc. might have been followed. What had been done several hundreds years back by a king invading a country or between war of two kings is obviously beyond the pale of judicial review of this Court and of any Court functioning in independent India after the promulgation of our Constitution on 26.01.1950. We have not been shown of any authority by any learned counsels that we can examine the legality, correctness or genuinity of an action of a Ruler prior to the enforcement of British enactments in the subcontinent. 1570. However, the attempt by some of the authors to glorify or justify brutal massacre or action of some of the invaders or Rulers even if they might have conquered the subcontinent, by providing justification, explanation etc. is not understandable for the reason that the things which are evident and straight cannot be clothed with a velvet cover and would not provide a shell to give it a different colour. It shall only mislead the public at large and in particular the students of history. In our view, the historical events must be placed straight without any distortion, without any addition of words and without providing any explanation or justification in the words of the author as the same would be nothing but a sheer conjecture and surmise. If we claim that Babar felt happy having seen the mound of human heads and still we tell somebody that he was a kind hearted religious man, had no love for violence it would a blatant lie. This kind of attitude on the part of some of authors whose work has been placed before us for our consideration shows that these authors can go to the extent of glorification of any kind of misdeed which in the present day's civilised society can never appreciate or swallow. If innocent persons are killed either in terrorist activities or naxalite activities, in our view the action of these persons ex facie is inhuman, amounts to henious offence, deserved to be condemned without mincing words so as not to dilute the degree of violence and atrocity committed by them irrespective of the purpose, objective or whatever is behind such activity. Any other view is nothing but a serious contempt to the very mankind and would be a clear disrespect to those innocents who become victim of such incidents. Though the present days activities may not have any comparison with the wars and battles fought hundreds and thousands years back but to find out a positive character in such activities of the the Ruler/Kings under whom the army had done all these kind of brutalities would be a thought of abnormal minds. The lack of respect of Emperor Babar to idols meant for worship has already been demonstrated above and is fortified from what has been mentioned at page 611 of the Book "Baburnama" by Beveridge stating that he did not hesitate in destroying the idols on 28.09.1528 at Uruwa (Gwalior) where he found three sites occupied by a solid rock wherein the people had cut out idols statue large and small and he ordered for destruction thereof. 1571. Ex. 82 (Suit-4) (Paper No. 218C1/1-20) contain certain pages from "Memoirs of Baber- Emperor of India" by Lieut. Colonel F.G. Talbot, first published 1974 by Ess Ess Publications, Delhi. This work is mainly based on the English translation of "Tuzuk-I-Babari" by John Leyden and William Erskine, first published in 1826 and it is said that the book being out of print for many years, therefore the Memoirs of Babar are practically now unknown. The author, however, has also taken help from Stanley Lane-Poole's Introduction to Babar. Pages no. I to XV from Chapter "Introduction", 1 to 3, 46 to 49 and 196 to 213 are before us. The attempt on the part of Sri Jilani is that from no part of the book it does appear that Babar ever encouraged destruction of Hindu temple or religious place of other religions. Sri H.S. Jain, on the contrary, submitted that his disliking to Hindus and other religions is writlarge from the fact that he addressed Hindus as 'Pagans' and declared war against Rana Sanga as 'Holy war' which shows his character and extreme religious fervour towards 'Islam'. He referred to the following passage from page 207 of the book (Paper No. 218C1/16) :
"From the eleventh year of my age till now, I had never spent two festivals of the Ramza in the same place. Last year's festival I had spent in Agra. In order to keep up the usage, on Sunday night the thirtieth, I proceeded to Sikri to keep the feast there. A stone platform was erected on the north-east of the Garden-of-Victory, on which a set of large tents was pitched, and in them I passed the festival.
The night on which we left Agra, Mir Ali departed. He was extremely fond of playing cards, and had asked for some, which I sent him."
1572. The issues need to be decided by this Court does not get any help from the above documents. One thing, however, is clear that the Babar came to India with a clear intention to stay and rule. In furtherance therefor, for keeping the morale of his force high and for other reasons, he took all necessary steps as he found expedient. It is evident from page 208 (Paper No. 218C1/17) and page 210 (Paper No. 218C1/18) :
"Hitherto the peoples of India had regarded Baber as a temporary raider who would depart as soon as he had gathered enough spoil; but when they found he had come to stay they began to consider what policy to pursue, and in weariness of incessant warfare began to see the merits of a master.
Three thousand Afghans from the Doab were the first to come over to him, and were rewarded with territories in Oudh, which was still in revolt.
One of the first acts of the Conqueror was to lay out a road from Agra to Kabul, and the distance having been actually measured, a tower twenty-four feet in height was erected at every fourteen miles, while at every sixteen miles a post-house for six horses was built, and an allowance fixed as a provision for post-house keeper, courier, grooms, and the keep of horses. Where the road lay through a rich man's territory he was made to pay all the costs of maintenance." (Page 208) "The affairs of Hindustan had now been reduced to a certain degree of order. The revenue from land was returned at 4,212,000/-. This was from land alone and by no means represented the total income." (Page 210) 1573. The life of Babar after his conquest was very short inasmuch it is not in dispute that he died on 26th December 1530 AD at Agra. Thereafter in the light of his last wish, he was buried in the garden on the hillside at Kabul. 1574. Ex. 83 (Suit-4) (Paper No. 220C1/1-11) and Ex. 84 (Suit-4) (Paper No. 222C1/1-5) are also the photocopies of certain pages from "Babarnama" translated by Yugjeet Navalpuri Edn. 2002 and nothing has been referred therefrom by the learned Counsels for the parties. We also do not find any thing therefrom which may throw any light for deciding the issues in question.
1575. Next in this context is about the persons whose name is claimed to have been mentioned on the inscriptions at the disputed site, i.e., "Mir Baqi". In the transcript of Fuhrer it mentions "Mir Khan" while in other transcript it is mentioned as "Mir Baqi".
1576. Sri P.N. Misra, Advocate has vehemently argued that the entire Baburnama does not mention any person in the army or otherwise relating to Babar with the name of Mir Baqi. He says that Baqi was a military decoration in the army of Babar and Mir was a civil honour to the persons of respectability etc. He says that the part of the army sent to Ayodhya was headed with Timur Begh, Baqi Tashkindi etc. but it does not mention any person as Mir Baqi.
1577. Sri P.N. Misra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of defendant no. 20 (Suit-4) supported the above stand and also contended that there is nothing in the said diary maintained by Babar that he ever entered Ayodhya either in March 1528 or in April 1528. It is common ground that the Babar-Nama misses the text between 2nd April to 18th September 1528 AD. The reason we are not concerned. Sri Jilani raised the above argument in order to buttress his submission that the Babar when did not enter Ayodhya himself there was no question of any demolition of a temple by him and construction of mosque. The pleadings of Hindu parties in connected suits to this effect are not correct, is what he tried to persuade us. Sri Misha, however, agree so far as the former part is concerned that there was no occasion for Babar himself to direct for demolition of any temple and construction of mosque since he did not enter Ayodhya but he tried to explain the things otherwise by submitting that this also shows that the disputed building was not constructed in 1528 AD and there is no historical document of contemporary period to substantiate the above claim of defendants no. 6 to 8 and 10 in Suit-1, the plaintiffs of Suit-4 and all muslim defendants in Suit-3 and 5. Sri Mishra also pointed out that Shaikh Bayazid was then governing Awadh/Ayodhya. The Army Commanders of Babar who crossed the river so as to enter Ayodhya were Tardi Beg of Quj Beg, Baba Chuhra, Baqi Shaghawal and Chin Timur. It is pointed out that there is no person named as Mir Baqi in the entire Babur-Nama. Sri Mishra placed before the Court Babur- Nama by Beveridge to show that it mentions Baqi Beg Chaghaniani; Qib Chaq Turk; Baqi Gagiani Afghan; Baqi Hiz; Kwaja Baqi son of Yahiya son of Ehrari who was murdered in 1500 AD; Baqi Beg Taskindi; Baqi Beg Shaghawal; Baqi Beg Mingbashi; Baqi Takhan. Sri Mishra submitted that there is no mention of any Mir Baqi in Babur-Nama. Our attention was also drew to page 684 of Beveridge's Babur-Nama to show that it is Baqi Tashkindi who came from Awadh (Ayodhya) on 13.06.1529 AD to meet Babar. Page 685 of Babur-Nama shows that Babar sent Baqi Shaghawal on 16.06.1529 while camping near Kalpi to collect information about his enemy, i.e., Biban and Bayazid. On 17.06.1529 AD it is mentioned that one of Baqi Beg's retainers came informing that Baqi had beaten scouts of Biban and Bayazid, killed one of their good men, Mubarak Khan Jalwani and some others, sent in several heads, and one man alive. He says that Baqi Shaghawal has been addressed as Baqi Beg and Baqi Tashkindi who came from Ayodhya has been addressed as Baqi but there is no mention of any of the person addressed as Mir Baqi. It is contended by Sri Mishra, Advocate that the later historians/translators, of their own, identified Baqi Tashkindi as Baqi Shaghawal as well as Mir Baqi though in the entire Babur-Nama, Babar has not addressed anybody or any one as Mir Baqi. He drew our attention to certain persons whose name started with the word Mir, namely, Mir Bujurg Tirmizi; Mir Khurd Bakawal; Mir Mughul son of Abdul Wahab Saghawal; Mir Sang-Tarash; Mir Zadas of Khwast and none of these persons, he submit, can be said to be possibly addressed as Mir Baqi.
1578. In Lieut. Colonel F.G. Talbot's under the title "Memoirs of Baber Emperor of India First of the Great Moghuls" (Supra) on page 90, with respect to the events of the year 1504 AD there is a reference of Baqi Beg and on page 91 for the same period there is reference of Baqi Beg as well as Baqi Chaghiani. The relevant extract whereof are mentioned as under:
"At this same period, Baki Beg repeatedly, and with much earnestness, urged his sentiments, that to have two sovereigns in one country, and two generals in one army, was an unfailing source of confusion and ruin, and inevitably productive of rebellion, mutiny, and finally of dissolution; as the poet says--
'Ten dervishes may repose on one cloak, But two sovereigns cannot be contained in the same climate.
The man of God, when he eats half a loaf, Divides the other half among the poor and needy. If a king subdues a whole kingdom, nay a climate, Still, as before, he covets yet another."
At this period, information arrived that Sheibani Khan had taken Andejan. On hearing this news, Khosrou Shah, unable to support himself in Kundez, took the route of Kabul with his whole force. No sooner had he left Kundez, than one of his old and confidential servants occupied that fortress, and declared for Sheibani Khan. Just as I reached the Red River, three or four thousand heads of houses of the Moghul clans, who had been dependent on Khosrou Shah, came and joined me, with their whole families. Here, in order to gratify Baki Beg, I was obliged to discharge Kamber Ali, the Moghul, who has been so often mentioned. He was a thoughtless and rude talker; and Baki Beg could not put up with his manners.
When Khosrou Shah learned that the Moghul tribes had joined me, he felt his own helplessness; and, seeking no remedy left, sent his son-in-law as his envoy, to make professions of submission and allegiance, and to assure me that, if I would enter into terms with him, he would come and submit himself. As Baki Cheghaniani, a man of much weight, though steadily attached to my service, yet was not without a natural bias in favour of his brother, he recommended a compromise to be made, on condition that Khosrou's life should be spared, and his property left entirely to his own disposal. A treaty was accordingly concluded on these terms."
1579. Another name, namely, Baqi Tarkhan is mentioned at page 11 of Talbot's Memoirs of Baber (supra) and that is also with reference to a much earlier period. The extract wherein the above name is mentioned on page 11 is as under:
"Baki Terkhan was another. In the time of Sultan Ali Mirza, he rose to great consequence, his retainers amounting to five or six thousand. He was far from being in a proper state of subjection or obedience to Sultan Ali Mirza. He was very fond of hawking, and is said to have had seven hundred falcons at one time. His manners and habits were such as cannot well be described; he was educated and grew up in the midst of magnificence and state."
1580. Besides, on page 4 it mentions the name of Mir Ghias Taghai; on page 26 it mentions about Mir Shaha and has appreciated about his gallantries; on page 114 there is a reference of Mir Beder and his dancing in the events relating to the year 1506 AD; on page 116 there is reference of Mir Jaan and his singing; on page 174/175 Mir Miran is mentioned and on page 207 Mir Ali is referred but there is no reference of any Mir Baqi. Talbot has not said anything about the Ayodhya visit except that of page 208 where he has referred to Awadh once only in the following manner:
"Thee thousand Afghans from the Doab were the first to come over to him, and were rewarded with territories in Oudh, which was still in revolt."
1581. On behalf of plaintiffs (Suit-4) copies of certain pages of "Mughal Kalin Bharat-Babar (1526-1530) by Syed Athar Abbas Rizvi (Supra) have been filed which are marked as Exhibit 85, Suit-4 (paper No. 223C1 and 224C1/1-62). These photocopies are from the 1960 edition of the book. Pages No. 19-20, 49-50, 232-233, 272-281, 310-313, 318-320, 328-341, 353, 375, 380-387 and 420-421 have been filed. We, however, are referring from 2010 reprint since this book in its entirety is available to the Court. On page 272, the book narrates the incidents of 28.03.1528 and 02.04.1528 which is almost similar to what is contained in Beveridge's Babur-Nama for the said date but since it is a translation by a Muslim writer having authority on the subject which is admitted to the plaintiffs of Suit-4 also, we reproduce the same as under:

1582. The Rizvi's translation has referred to a large number of persons whose names have the title of 'Mir' on pages 716 and 717 as under:
"ehaj vrk mYykg; ehaj vcqy cd+k; ehaj vCnqy x+Q+wj; ehj vykmyeqYd frjfet+h; ehj vyh; ehj vyh csx; ehj vyh 'ksj; ehj vyh 'ksj uokbZ; ehj bczkghe; ehj bczkghe d+kuwuh; ehj [k+yhQ+k; ehj [kqnZ; ehj [kqnZ cdkoy; ehj x+;kl; ehj x+;kl rx+kbZ; ehj x+;klqn~nhu; ehj xslw; ehj tku; ehj tku bZjnh; ehj rhewjh [kjcwt+k; ehj njos'k eqgEen l+kjcku; ehj Q+kft+y; ehj cnz; ehj ehjku; ehj eqx+wy; ehj eqjrkt+; ehj eqgEen; ehj eqgEen vyh taxtax; ehj eqgEen tkykcku; ehj eqgEen ukfod; ehj eqgEen c[+'kh; ehj eqgEen ;wlqQ+; ehj 'kkg d+wphu; ehj 'kkg csx; ehj 'ksjhe; ehj laxrjk'k; ehj ljs cjguk; ehj lqYrku vyh [+okcchu; ehj lSf;n vyh genkuh; ehj lSf;n jQ+hmn~nhu eqgfn~nl lQ+oh; ehj geg; ehj gek; ehj gqlsu; ehj gqlsu eqvEekbZ"
1583. On page 659 he has mentioned the words Amir Mir Baqi but that is with reference to his translation of stone inscriptions said to be there on the disputed building with which we have already discussed. In the entire translation of Babur- Nama and other description there is no mention of anyone as Mir Baqi. The aforesaid work also nowhere mention or shows that Babar at any point of time did enter Ayodhya or Awadh after reaching near thereto on 28.03.1528 though it is said that he stayed thereat for about a few days.
Traveller's Account 1584. There are two travellers account which have to be considered at this stage. One that of "William Finch" and another is that of "Father Joseph Tieffenthaler". 1585. William Foster published a book, namely, "Early Travels in India" (1985 First Edition distributed by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd.) which contains the narratives of seven Englishmen who traveled in northern and western India during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. These travelers are Ralph Fitch (1583-91); John Mildenhall (1599-1606); William Hawkins (1608-13); William Finch (1608-11); Nicholas Withington (1612-16); Thomas Coriyat (1612-17) and Edward Terry (1616-19). William Finch came to India in August 1608 and landed at Surat with Capt. Hawkins. With respect to Ayodhya, Finch has written on page 176 of the book as under :
"To Oude (Ajodhya) from thence are 50 c.; a citie of ancient note, and seate of a Potan king, now much ruined; the castle built foure hundred yeeres agoe. Heere are also the ruines of Ranichand(s) castle and houses, which the Indians acknowled(g)e for the great God, saying that he tooke flesh upon him to see the tamasha of the world. In these ruines remayne certaine Bramenes, who record the names of all such Indians as wash themselves in the river running thereby; which custome, they say, hath continued foure Iackes of yeeres (which is three hundred ninetie foure thousand and five hundred yeeres before the worlds creation). Some two miles on the further side of the river is a cave of his with a narrow entrance, but so spacious and full of turnings within that a man may well loose himself there, if he take not better heed; where it is thought his ashes were buried. Hither resort many from all parts of India, which carry from hence in remembrance certaine graines of rice as blacke as gun-powder, which they say have beene reserved ever since. Out of the ruines of this castle is yet much gold tryed. Here is greate trade, and such abundance of Indian asse-horne that they make hereof bucklers and divers sorts of drinking cups. There are of these hornes, all the Indians affirme, some rare of great price, no jewell comparable, some esteeming them the right unicornes horne."
Photocopy of page 176 of the book is Exhibit 19 Suit-5 (Register 21 Page 271) 1586. William Finch who visited Ayodhya between 1608- 1611 AD neither found any building of importance of Muslim nor Muslim population nor any activity of Muslims noteworthy in Ayodhya. Had the building in dispute been constructed in 1528 i.e. just about 80 years back, it is quite difficult to understand that would not have been considered to be a place of importance and could have gone unnoticed by Finch. He has specifically referred to Castle of Lord Ram Chandra Ji which, in his understanding, constructed about 400 years ago. Obviously, it could not be related to the building in dispute as such. Here also what he says that there existed ruins of Ram Chandra's castle and houses which the Indians acknowledge the Great God. He also says that in these ruins certain Brahmins used to record the names of visiting Indians which is a practice still in continuance in various holy places and those Brahmin people are normally called as Panda/Mahraj where one can find the record of hundreds of years back belonging to their predecessors who had earlier visited these holy places. 1587. Sri Jilani sought to argue that write up of William Finch lends no credence for it does not mention very clearly as to which place in Ayodhya he visited. However, Sri Jilani also could not suggest that in Ayodhya there is any place other than that which included the disputed site which may or could be considered to be the fort of King Dashrath or Lord Rama in ancient times. At least this much cannot be disputed that William Finch's travel account did not find mention of any big building known as "Babri Mosque" to have existed in Ayodhya having been constructed just about 80 years ago before his visit. His travel account suggests that the number of Muslim inhabitants in Ayodhya city in earlier 17th Century was negligible.
1588. Next comes another travel account of "Father Joseph Tieffenthaler" who visited India sometime in 1740 and remained here for about 20-25 years. He also visited Ayodhya during his above stay and had written travel account which was written in Latin in the book "DESCRIPTION : HISTORIQUE ET GEOGRAPHIQUE : D E L' I N D E" under the title "TOME 1. NOUVELLE EDITION. Contenant la Geographic de l'Ind-Uftan, avec. 39,. Planches". English translation of which is "HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF INDIA" VOLUME 1 NEW EDITION containing the Geography of Hindustan, with 39 illustrations". The account of Tieffenthaler was translated in French and was published by M. Jean Bernoulli in 1786, photo copy of the first two pages of the French publication as well as pages no. 252 to 255 was provided to this Court which has been marked as Exhibit No. OOS 5-133 (Paper No. 107 C/96-104) (Register 21 page 273-289).
1589. The aforesaid documents were written in French (except of very few words which were in Lati). Since the English translation supplied by plaintiffs (Suit-5) was seriously disputed, we directed the Government of India to get an authenticated English Translation of the aforementioned pages which have been made available to us and after giving opportunity to the parties to file their objection has been admitted vide order dated 10.03.2010. The relevant part in the aforesaid report, i.e.,pages 253 is reproduced as under:
"L'empereur Aurengzebe a fait demolir la fortereffe appelee ramcot, & a eleve au meme lieu un temple mahometan, a triple coupole. D'autres difent qu'il a etc conftruit par Babor. On y voit I 4 colonnes de pierre noire, hautes de 5 empans, qui occupoient l'emplacement de la fortereffe. Douze de ces colonnes portent maintenant les arcades intericures de la Mosquee: deux (de ces I 2) font placees a la porte du cloitre. Les deux autres font partie du tombeau d'un certain Maure. On raconte que ces colonnes, ou plutot ces debris de colonnes artiftement travaillees ont etc apportees de l'ile de Lanca ou Selendip [appelee Ceylan par les Europeens] par Hanumann, Roi des Singes."
Emperor Aurengzebe got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place. Others say that is was constructed by 'Babor'. Fourteen black stone pillars of 5 span high, which had existed at the site of the fortress, are seen there. Twelve of these pillars now support the interior arcades of the mosque. Two (of these
12) are placed at the entrance of the cloister. The two others are part of the tomb of some 'Moor'. It is narrated that these pillars, or rather this debris of the pillars skillfully made, were brought from the island of Lanca or Selendip (called Ceylan by the Europeans) by Hanuman, King of Monkeys.
(English transliteration) 1590. Sri Mishra pointed out that there appears to be an english translation also of the travel record of Tieffenthaler. He refers to the english translation of Tieffenthaler in para 5 of his written argument and gave a brief biodata of father Tieffenthaler in para 6 which read:
"5. Father Josef Tieffenthaler, a Jesuit Missionary and noted geographer on Hindustan visited Ayodhya in 1770 did not find any Inscriptions even that superscription "Allah" mentioned by the Ld. District Judge in 1886.
From Josef Tiffenthaler's description it appears that at that time also Hindus were worshipping inside the Ramjanmsthan Temple alleged to be converted into mosque either by Aurangzeb or by Babar. As he was not only a Missionary but an excellent Historian, Geographer and great linguistic having mastery over several languages including Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, there was no possibility of overlooking the alleged Inscriptions by him as it would have enabled him to tell the people with certainty the name of the Tyrant Emperor who attempted to convert Sri Ramajanmasthan Temple into Mosque. English translation of a portion of his book "Descriptio Indiae" being description of Oude including the Sri Ramajanmasthan has been published on pages 312 to 317 in the " Modern Traveller, a Popular Description, Geographical, Historical, and Topographical of the Various Countries of the Globe- India. Vol. III" ; London Edn.1828 published by James Duncan and has been digitalised by Google. Relevant extracts thereof read as follows:
"Its appearance, in 1770, is thus described by Tieffen Thaler: "Avad with Ajudea by the learned Hindoos, is a city of the highest Antiquity." ......... (Ibid.312) "The most remarkable place is that which is called Sorgodoari, that is to say, the heavenly temple; because they say, that Ram carried away from thence to heaven all the inhabitants of the city. The deserted town was repeopled and restored to its former condition by Bikaramajit, the famous King of Oojein. There was a temple here on the high bank of the river; but Aurangzebe, ever attentive to the propagation of faith of Mohammed, and holding the heathen in abhorrence, caused it to be demolished, and replaced it with a mosque with minarets, in order to abolish the very memory of Hindoo superstition. Another mosque has been built by the Moors, to the East of this near the Sorgodoari in an edifice erected by Nabalroy, a former Hindoo governor. But a place more particularly famous is that which is called Sitha Rassoce, a table of Sitha (Seeta), wife of Ram; situated on an eminence to the south of the city. The emperor Aurangzebe demolished the fortress called Ramcote, and erected on the site of Mohammedan temple with a triple dome. According to others, it was erected by Baber. There are to be seen fourteen columns of black stone, five spans in height, occupied the site of the fortress. Twelve of these columns now support the interior arcades of the mosque: the two other form part of the tomb of a certain Moor. They tell us that these columnsms, are rather these remains of skillfully wrought columns, were brought from the Isle of Lanca or Selendip (Ceylon) by Hanuman, King of the Monkeys. On the left is seen a square chest, raised five inches from the ground covered with lime about 5 ells in length by not more than four in breadth. The Hindoos call it Bedi. The cradle; and the reason is, that there formerly stood here the house in which Beshan (Vishnoo) was born in the form of Ram, and were also, they say, is three brothers were born. Afterwards, Aurangzebe or, according to others, Baber caused the place to be destroyed, in order to deprive the heathen of the opportunity of practising there their superstitions. Nevertheless, they still pay superstitious reverence to both these places; namely, to that on which the Natal dwelling Ram stood, by going three times around it, prostrate on the earth. The two places are surrounded with a low wall adorned with battlements. Not far from this is a place where they dig up grains of black rice changed into little stones, which are affirmed to have been hidden under ground ever since the time of Rama. On the 24th of the month of Tshet (Choitru), a large concourse of people celebrate here the birth-day of Ram, so famous throughout India."...... (Ibid. 313- 314)
6. Josef Tieffenthaler was born at Bozen in the Tyrol, on 27th August, 1710 and died at Lucknow on 5 July, 1785. He entered the Society of Jesus 9 October, 1729, and went in 1740 to the East Indian mission where he occupied various positions, chiefly in the empire of the Great Moghul. After the suppression of the Society he remained in India, and on his death was buried in the mission cemetery at Agra, where his tombstone still stands. He was a fine scholar with an unusual talent for languages; besides his native tongue he understood Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hindustani, Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit. He was the first European who wrote an exact description of Hindustan. A brief list of his works is the best proof of his extraordinary power of work and his varied scholarship. In geography, he wrote a "Descriptio Indiae", that is a circumstantial description of the twenty two provinces of India, of its cities, fortresses, and the most important smaller towns, together with an exact statement of geographical positions, calculated by means of a simple quadrant. He wrote a large book on the courses of the Ganga. In history, he wrote many books. He wrote on the origin of the Hindus and their religion in Latin, expeditions of Nadir Shah to India in German, the Deeds of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam in Persian, Incursions of the Afghans and the Conquest of Delhi in French. He wrote a book on contemporary history 1757-64. In linguistics he prepared a Sanskrit-Parsee Lexicon, treatises in Latin on the language of the Parsees, on the proper pronunciation of Latin, etc.. In the area of religion, he wrote 'Brahmanism' and works on Indian polytheism, Indian asceticism, the religion of Parsee Islam and relations of these religions to one another.In the field of the natural sciences he wrote on astronomical observations on the sunspots and zodiacal light, studies on the Hindu astronomy, astrology and cosmology. In addition, he wrote on the descriptions and observations of the flora and fauna of India. Thus he was an intellectual giant and a linguistic wizard and not mere a traveller or a merchant who made casual remarks. His published works along with biographical notes can be lucidly gleaned from Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) and 'Christianty in India' through Wikisource and Wikipedia's website respectively. His writings and contributions also find place in the books

1591. Sri P.N. Mishra argued that Father Joseph Tieffenthaler himself was a linguist knowing Persian and Arabic very well. Had the inscriptions two or three, as the case may be, whatever, fixed to the disputed building till the time he visited Ayodhya including the disputed site, he could have himself read the same and would have mentioned categorically that the building in dispute was constructed by Babur. There could not have been any occasion in such a case to mention that there was a demolition by Aurangzeb and construction of mosque by him and thereafter further that some says that it was done by Babur. Sri Mishra suggested that Aurangzeb died in 1707 A.D. and had ruled the most part of the country for about forty-eight years. Whether he himself visited Ayodhya or not is irrelevant for the reason that his Farman (command) for demolition of Hindu temples is referred to in several history books including some of the contemporary Muslim literature written by Muslim authors. He argued that the existing Hindu temple was demolished by Aurangzeb and it is during his regime, the disputed building was constructed but at that time no inscription was installed thereat. These inscriptions did not exist till Father Joseph Tieffenthaler visited Ayodhya including the disputed site between 1740 to 1760-65. He pointed out that the inscriptions on the disputed building came to be noticed for the first time by Dr. Francis Buchanan who was appointed by the Governor General in Council to undergo a survey of the Provinces ruled by the Presidency of Bengal in 1807 AD visited Ayodhya in 1810 AD. 1592. Here it would of some importance to have an idea of biography of Dr. Francis Buchanan. He was borne at Bardowie, Callander Perthshire on 15th February, 1762. His family originated in Spittal and claim the Chiefdom of the name of Buchanan. He studied medicines at the University of Edinburgh. He also studied Botany under John Hope in Edinburgh. After several voyages on merchant navy ship to area, he served in the Bengal Medical Service from 1794 to 1815 AD. From 1803 to 1804 AD he was Surgeon to the Governor General of India, Lord Wellesley in Calcutta. There he organised a Zoo, later known as Calcutta Alipore Zoo. He worked on Indian Fish Species entitled "An account of fishes found in the river Ganges and its branches (1822)" which describes over 100 species not formerly recognised scientifically. He also collected and described very new plants in the region and collected a series of Watercolours of Indian and Nepalese plants and animals, probably painted by Indian artists, which they say that they are now in the library of Linnean Society of London. After Tipu Sultan's defeat in 1799 AD he was asked to survey Southern India resulting in a journey from Madras through the countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (1807 AD). From 1807 to 1814 AD under the instructions of the Governor General and Council, Bengal he made a survey of the areas within the jurisdiction of the British East India Company, i.e., the provinces subject to the Presidency of Bengal. He became Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden in 1814 but due to his ill health return to Britain in 1815 AD. In the same year he inherited his mother's estate and in consequence took her surname of Hamilton, referring himself as "Francis Hamilton, formerly Buchanan" or simply "Francis Hamilton". However, he is variously referred to by others as "Buchanan Hamilton", "Francis Hamilton Buchanan" or "Francis Buchanan Hamilton". He is considered to be Scottish Physician who made significant contribution as a Geographer, Zoologist and Botanist while living in India. He died on 15.06.1829.
1593. Apparently work of Dr. Buchanan could not be given final shape by him. However, it appears that three journals were published by the government of Bihar and Orissa sometime in 1923 AD and onwards. One was published relating to Patna and Gaya districts sometimes in 1923 AD under the editorship of Mr. Jackson, another was published soon thereafter dealing with the district of Sahabad under the care of Mr. Oldham and third one was published narrating the survey of District Bhagalpur conducted in the cold weather of 1810-11 AD edited by Mr. Oldham.
1594. As already said, in 1807 AD under the orders of Governor General and Council, East India Company Dr. Francis Buchanan was directed to conduct survey of all the provinces subject to the Presidency of Bengal. He was required to collect information upon the general topography of each districts; the condition of the inhabitants, their religious customs, the natural productions of the country, fisheries, forests, mines and quarries; the state of agriculture; the condition of landed property and tenures; the progress made in the arts and manufactures; the operations of commerce, and every particular that can be recorded, as forming an element, in the prosperity or depression of the people. The survey was pursued for seven years and in 1816 AD the results were transmitted to England. 1595. Due to bad health of Dr. Buchanan the matter could not proceed and it appears that the East India Company thereafter took the help of Mr. Robert Montgomery Martin. The Court of Directors permitted Mr. Martin to inspect the manuscripts with a view to selection for publication. It was sometimes in 1836 or 1838 Mr. Martin was required to study the material collected by Dr. Buchanan, prepare a report so as to place before the British public.
1596. This leads us to look into the biography of "Robert Montgomery Martin". Born in Dublin of Protestant Irish Stock in 1801 AD he spent 10 years in medical practice in Shillong, East Africa and New South Wells and working as journalist in Calcutta. There he helped, found and edit "The Bengal Herald" before he return to Britten. He wrote on the colonies and colonial policy. On return he become embroiled in domestic, political and economic debate. In politics he initially supported Repeal of the Act of Union between England and Ireland but later switched to pro-unionism on religious and economic grounds. In economics he was an opponent of popular recardianism. He called for repeal of the 1819 AD currency legislation; vigorously advocated protectionism for British agricultural; concern himself with the principle of taxation. Due to limited personal finances and an interest in policy matters he sought Government patronage for official employment or financial support.
1597. Buchanan made survey in the then territory of District Behar, Shahabad, Bhagulpoor, Goruckpoor, Dinajpoor, Puraniya, Ronggopoor and Assam. Mr. Martin found that the time when the survey was made and when he was required to inspect the manuscripts has made certain matters irrelevant. He, therefore, in his wisdom confined his views to an examination of the geography and physical aspect of the country; to its traditional or recorded history, to the monuments or relics of antiquity; physical and moral conditions of the people amounting (according to the survey estimates) to 1.6 crore and to the resources of the soil which they till; the manufactures which carry on; and to the products and profits of agricultural and commercial industry. In his views the survey depicted a painful picture of human poverty, debasement and wretchedness. The report was submitted by Mr. Martin in February' 1838 which was first published in 1838. It has now been reprinted in 1976 in India by Cosmo Publications, Delhi. Martin's report has been published under the title "Eastern India" and is running in six volumes. It is a matter of importance that Martin has not claimed to have visited North West Provinces of India under East India Company. His entire opinion is based only on the perusal of record sent by Buchanan. 1598. In the Chapter "District Gorukhpoor", certain facts about Ayodhya have been given. District Gorukhpoor (now spelt as "Gorakhpur") at that time situated to the left or north of the river Ghoghra. According to survey map published in Vol-2 and printed between page 290 and 291, book titled as "Eastern India" by Mortin, we find that on the western and southern side, the boundary wall is depicted by the rivers Gharghara/Ghaghara and Saryu; and on the northern and western side, the entire area termed as Domain of Nawab Vazir of Oudh. About river Ghaghra, description is on page 297 as under :
"Ghaghra. - The accounts of the great river, which passes the ancient city of Ayodhya, that I have received, differ not only very much from the maps of Danville and Rennell, but disagree very much among themselves. The confusion is increased to the most perplexing degree by very different names being not only given to different parts of the same river ; but even the very same portion by different people and tribes is called by different names.
Finally the native maps, that I have received of the country; through which the remote branches of this river flow, are more imperfect than those of the country either to the east or west, so that what I have to advance on the subject is liable to great doubt ; but as the information, if true is curious, I think, that until more accurate information is obtained, it should not be neglected.
At the city of Ayodhya this great river among the Hindus is usually called Sarayu (Soorjew, Rennell), and this name is in use in their sacred language; but by the Muhammedans it is called Ghaghra, from the Sangskrita word Gharghara. This name Mr. Gladwin (Ayeen Akbery) wrote sometimes Gehgher, sometimes Goghar; and Major Rennell writes it Gogra. The mountaineers from the east side of this river assure me, that neither name is known on the hills, and that the Sarayu celebrated in their legends is formed by the junction of the Bheri river, which I take to be the Soorjew of Major Rennell, with the Karanali Salasu, or Sanbhadrik, which is no doubt the Gogra of that eminent geographer, as the remarkable fountains emitting flame at Dulubasandra are situated near its bank. The inhabitants of the low country also in general agree with Major Rennell, in calling the eastern branch the Sarayu, and the western the Ghaghra, but the western branch which they mean, is quite different from that on which Dulubasandra is situated, and at any rate its principal branch on the mountains is the Kalinadi. Both these authorities therefore, that is, the mountaineers east from the river, and the people of the low country agree, that a great river coming from the west, and named the Ghaghra, unites with the Sarayu, coming from the east, and that this latter among the Hindus is considered as the principal river, and communicates its name to the united stream while the Muhammedans adopt the opposite opinion, and continue the name Ghaghra to the river at Ayodhya. A learned and intelligent Brahman, however, Hariballabh of Kuman, from the mountains on the west side of the river, and perfectly acquainted both with the country and the legends, says, that the names Sarayu and Ghaghra are applicable to the same river, through the whole length of its course. That it rises by two petty sources in the Pergunahs of Karuvirpoor and Danapoor, on the hills north form Almorha ; but far removed from the snowy peaks of Emodus. These two torrents uniting at Bagheswar form the Sarayu, which continues to run east, receiving the Panar a small channel producing gold, and the Ramagangga of considerable size. Some way east from the junction of the latter, the Sarayu receives a river much larger than itself, which rises from the perennial snows of Emodus, and is called the Kalinadi. The united stream is the Sarayu, or Gharghara, and passes south-westerly towards the plains, nor does my informant know more of its course ; but, that it passes by Ayodhya to join the Ganges at Dadri, he has learned from legend.
The account of the most intelligent boatmen that I could procure at Ayodhya, is as follows. The boats which load timber, can proceed no higher up the Ghaghra than Mundiya ghat, which is in the Bareli district, about 18 coss, or 27 miles, road measure, from Pilibhit. The channel is there very wide, but the stream is not large, and is not above two cubits deep. The territory of Gorkha commences about seven or eight coss from Mundiya, at a large forest named Langsar, from which much timber comes. About twelve coss below Mundiya the Ghaghra receives from the mountains a branch called Neaula, down which much timber comes from the territory subject to Gorkha. Twelve coss lower down, it receives the Kauriya, and immediately below its mouth a third named the Geruya enters. Timber is brought down both these rivers, and on the latter, in the dominions of Gorkha, are two great forest, Amba and Palamu. I suspect, that the Kauriyar and Geruya, and perhaps even the Neaula are only different mouths of the same river, which in the mountains is called Setigangga, or the white river. The Hindus have given the preference to the Sarayu, which is said to be the smallest, nor is the larger branch any where fordable below the mouth of the Bhakosa. The united channel begins to form the boundary between this district and the territories of the Nawab Vazir, just at the city of Ayodhya, where its channel and stream seem fully larger than that of the Ganges at Chunar. For about 18 miles below Ayodhya its width is from one to three miles, as it surrounds two very large islands, the property of the upper of which is disputed by the landholders of the two governments; but the lower is the undisputed property of the Muhammedan prince. About ten miles above where the Ghaghra comes to be the boundary, it sends off a channel merely called the Sota, or branch, which runs parallel to the main river for above six miles, forming for more than four the boundary between the two governments, when it joins the Teri river. I crossed this branch on the 11th of December, where it was about a quarter of a mile wide, and perhaps a fourth of the channel might be covered with water knee deep, but nearly stagnant.
The Teri comes to the boundary of this district, about 14 miles from where it receives the above-mentioned branch of the Ghaghra, and, at the boundary receives from the north-west a marshy channel called the Nawara jhil, which forms the boundary for about four miles. The united channel called Teri is inconsiderable, and winds much, partly along the boundary, and partly on both sides of it, until about four miles from where it receives the branch of the Ghaghra called Sota. It there joins with a similar branch of that river called Bhagala, which for some way serves as the boundary. The united channel is called the Teri." (pages 297-300) 1599. Dealing with historical and topographical part of District Gorakhpur, on page 325 and onwards it says :
"This district forms a considerable part of the territory, which in ancient legend is called Maha Kosala.
....... This very extensive and fertile region has always been considered as the proper patrimony of the family of the sun, as it is called, which for a very long period governed large portions of India and at times produced its paramount lords." (page 325) 1600. The study which was conducted by Martin, the source of his information etc. in writing this chapter and in particular what he has observed on pages 325 to 337 can not be well understood unless we go through details of his entire discussion on the matter and, therefore, it would be necessary to reproduce the following from his book :
"The history of the Hindus has been thrown into such confusion by an attempt to reconcile the actual succession of their princes with a modern system of astronomy, as most ably explained by Mr. Bentley in the eighth volume of the Asiatic Researches, that the utmost difficulty attends all attempts to reconcile with any thing like reason such ancient accounts as have been preserved in the monstrous and modern legends called the Purans.
The difficulties attending this subject may be fully appreciated by examining the different attempts of Sri William Jones in the second volume, of Major Wilford in the fifth volume, and of Mr. Bentley in the eighth volume of the Asiatic Researches, although in the latter the real source of the difficulties seems to have been fully discovered. Still, however, many great difficulties exist, which these authors have not fully explained, and of which the two first do not seem to have been fully aware. Sir William Jones seems, without examination, to have adopted the account given of the Indian dynasties by Radhakanta, in his Puranartha-prakasa, as the doctrine generally received by the Hindus on the subject, and alleges (Asiatic Researches, vol. 2, page 26), that it begins with an absurdity so monstrous as to overthrow the whole system, he then endeavours to turn the whole of the early pedigree into an allegory, denying altogether the existence of many princes, because their names signify light, sky, sun, moon and so forth; although he might have considered, that such names are sometimes used for men among ourselves, and among the present Hindus are very common. The grand objection to the system of Radhakanta is, however, his having adopted as a maxim, that there was always a supreme king of each of the families of the sun and moon, so that India, according to him, was governed like Lacedaemon, by two chiefs of two families possessing equal power ; and that each dynasty contained exactly the same number of generations in the respective periods, into which the history is divided. This is a fable like many others, usually called opinions universally received among the Hindus, which Mr. Bantley (Asiatic Researches, vol. 8, page 244) so justly exposes. But the receiving it, as an universally acknowledged opinion, led Sir William Jones, from the imperfect lists composed by Radhakanta, to doubt whether any such personages as the Indian princes of the families of the sun and moon existed (Asiatic Researches, vol. 2, page 131). Had Sir Willam consulted the various genealogies contained in the different Purans, he would have found, that this opinion, by which he was staggered, rested entirely on the imagination of Radhakanta, or of some person from whom he borrowed it, and could not be supported by the remains of history in the Purans. So far as I can learn from Pandits, that I have employed to extract the Hindu genealogies from their books, there was only one paramount king admitted at a time, and in general the succession to this power was totally irregular, not only between the tow great families, but among the branches of the same family, and, as I have mentioned in the account of Shahabad, was as irregular as the succession in Ireland during the government of the families descended of Heber and Heremon. It would even appear, that the succession to the supremacy was not strictly confined to the two families of the sun and moon, as Pandu and his successors were in fact descended of Vayasa ; and also that many intervals occurred, in which no one king possessed paramount authority.
The table given by Major Wilfort is highly valuable ; although, when he says, that it is extracted from the Vishnu Puran, the Bhagawat, and other Puranas, without the least alteration whatever, we are only to understand, that Major Wilford made no alteration on the table, after it was extracted by his assistants from the Hindu records ; for the genealogies contained in the different books, to which he alludes, differ so much from each other, that no one table could be constructed from them without making numerous alterations. This interesting table is however exceedingly valuable in showing how nearly these genealogies, by taking the human age at a just valuation may be reconciled with the real eras pointed out by Mr. Bentley, on astronomical data. It must however be evident, that both systems are liable to some doubt. In the first place there is a very great difficulty in establishing any calculation upon the number of generations contained in the Hindu genealogies, owing to the very great carelessness, with which they have been constructed. Besides numerous transpositions it would seem, that in many parts, what in one Genealogy is detailed as a succession of several generations, is given in another genealogy as a list of brothers, so that by the former process the length of a dynasty is monstrously enlarged. Again in some genealogies a whole dynasty is represented by a single name, which occasions the most absurd anachronisms to be commonly received as canonical, by such as have studied only a part of these genealogies. These anachronisms are so distressing, that some learned persons have considered as quite vain the attempt of founding any thing like a regular chronology on the Hindu genealogies. I hope however, that this judgement is too harsh, and that a careful perusal of all the remains may lead to something as satisfactory as chronologies of equal antiquity usually admit. So far as I can at present judge, for I have not yet procured any thing like a full copy of the genealogies, the eras, even as curtailed by Major Wilford and Mr. Bentley, would require to be considerably reduced. I consider it necessary to reduce the former from the numerous interpolations of brothers and collaterals in place of sons. The argument of Mr. Bentley goes only to show the manner, in which some former systems of chronology, detailed in the Graha Mangjari, have been deformed by the present system of Varaha Mihira ; but these ancient systems were also mere astronomical fictions, and, although their application to history was not attended with such monstrous difficulties, as the present system, there is nothing in its nature to show, that it is in any degree connected with what actually happened. One great difficulty occurs relative to the deluge, which Mr. Bentley and Major Wilford agree in placing immediately before the government of the family of the Sun in Kosala commenced, so that they consider the government of Swayambhuwa and his successors, kings of Vithora (Betoor Rennell) near Kanpoor, as in the antediluvian age, while Swayambhuwa they call Adam, and Vaiwaswata father of the first king of Kosala, they call Noah. One of the legends, on which this opinion rests has been given by Sir William Jones (Asiatic Researches, vol.2, page 117); but this, as explained by the Pandits, whom I have consulted, is not reconcilable with the opinion above mentioned; and these Brahmans insist, that no general deluge (Pralaya) has taken place since the time of Swayambhuwa. The mistake consists in supposing, that Satyabrata (Satjavrata) and Vaiwaswata are the same person, and that whatever is related of one, may be attributed to the era of the other. But the Brahmans say, that these two personages, although the same soul in different transmigrations, lived at very remote periods, Satyavrata having been saved in an ark by God, when the deluge happened, while in his subsequent birth as Vaiwaswata, after an interval of many ages, he became a law-giver (Manu or Mamu), and founded the city of Ayodhya. It must be farther observed, that although the legend concerning the escape of Satyabrata or Satyarupa has a strong resemblance to the history of Noah, he is far from being considered by the Hindus as being like Noah the second father of the human race ; but he is said to have died without children, and was born again in the family of the Sun ; while Swayambhuwa was created to people the world after the deluge ; and from him were descended the first kings of India, who governed at Vithora, and who were perhaps natives, although it is possible, that they may have been Assyrians. In place therefore of allowing the family of the Sun to have governed from the time of the deluge, and that the Treta yug or silver age extended to that event, we must, I imagine, allow the golden age or Satya yug, and the government of the descendants of Swayambhuwa to be subsequent to that period, and of course must bring the time, when the kingdom of Kosala was founded, much latter than Major Wilford and Mr. Bentley do. Could we depend on the accuracy of the numbers, as Sir William Jones observes, there is circumstance mentioned by Abul Fazil, that could throw much light on this subject. It would appear that, the Brahmans, whom that person consulted, had not always applied to the history of their princes the astronomical fictions of Varaha Mihira, and they placed the birth of Budha, I presume the grandson of Atri, and son in law of Vaiwaswata first king of Ayodhya, in the year 1366 before the birth of Christ (Asiatic Researches vol.
2.p.125). This entirely coincides with the opinion I have above stated, and places the commencement of the historical silver age, commencing with Budha, in the 1366th year before Christ, in place of the 2204th as given by Mr. Bentley from the astronomical systems of the Graha Mungjari. Such a reduction on the era of the silver age, and foundation of the kingdom of Kosala I am far from thinking absolutely necessary; but on the whole I am inclined to believe, that it approaches near the truth than the systems of Major Wilford or Mr. Bentley, although I must confess, as I have mentioned, that the coincidence of the two systems, founded on principles totally different, affords a strong presumption in favour of the result.
In Hindu legend the appearance of certain persons named Brahmadikas created by God, and commonly called the progenitors of every living thing, forms a remarkable era, but the accounts concerning these personages are totally dissonant, as may be seen in the account of Major Wilford (Asiatic Researches, vol. 5, page
246). One authority makes the three sons of Swayambhuwa to have been the Brahmadikas, placing them thus at the commencement of the golden, and not at the beginning of the silver age; and I have already stated my opinion, that these were the aboriginal inhabitants or earliest conquerors of India, but other authority give another class totally different, and always containing Marichi, Atri, Anggirasa, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kritu, and Vasishtha, while others add Daksha, Bhrigu and Narada. The descendants of these personages governed India both in spirituals and temporals from the commencement of the silver age until about the time when the Greeks made their appearance, and numerous chiefs still claim to be of their family. They are all called Brahmans, either as being created by the God of that name, or perhaps more probably as being persons more intelligent than those who preceded them; far from being all of the sacred order, the greater part of their descendants were princes, statesmen and soldiers, and one in particular is stated to have been a merchant (Vaisya).
We have seen that Swayambhuwa, the founder of the kingdom of Vithora, by the whole of what is called the golden age (Satya yug), preceded Vaiwaswata, the founder of the kingdom of Kosala, and the latter was the great grandson of Marichi, while Budha, who founded the adjacent kingdom of Kuru, and reigned at Pratisthan, opposite to Prayag, about the same time with Vaiwaswata, whose daughter he married, was the grandson of Atri. I look upon these Brahmadikas, therefore, as the leaders of a colony, which at the end of the golden age, settled in India, and assumed the name of Brahmans , as being farther advanced in the arts than the descendants of Swaymbhuwa, its more early princes. I look upon it also as probable, that these personages came from western Asia, introducing with them the Sangskrita language, generally admitted to be radically the same with the Persian dialect, while the languages spoken among all the rude tribes that inhabit the fastnesses of India, and which are probably remains of its ancient tongue, have no sort of analogy to the languages of the west. In the history of Kasmira, preserved by Abul Fazil, Kasyap, who was the son of Marichi, is said to have introduced the Brahmans (that is, a colony of civilized men) into that country, and the traditions of Behar state, that he there founded a city, of which I was shown some of the remains. These no doubt were of much later date than the time of Kasyap, although he may have been the founder of the city to which they once belonged. One of the sons of Kasyap, named Viwaswa, is supposed to be now the deity presiding over the sun, owing probably to his having introduced from Persia the worship of that luminary, and, from flattery, his descendants were usually called the family of the sun (Suryabangsa). His son Vaiwaswata, who, in a former transmigration, had been Satyabrata (perhaps Noah), founded the kingdom of Kosala, long one of the most powerful in India, and built the city of Kosalapoori, or Ayodhya.
If I am right in supposing that Budha was born about 1366 years before Christ, he being the son-in-laws of Vaiwaswata, it is probable that this prince may have been born about the year 1399, and we may allow him to have been 33 years old when he founded Ayodhya, and the kingdom of Kosala. In the genealogies may be found several different lists of his successors, who are commonly supposed by Pandits to have succeeded each other from father to son, by right of primogeniture, nor did one prince fail to leave his kingdom to his eldest son for many generations (Asiatic Researches, vol. 2, p. 130). This, however, seems to be a mere supposition taken for granted, because in some of the genealogies the names follow each other without any remark, for the direct line failed in Ambarisha, and went to the descendants of his brother; and Bharata usurped the government for 14 years from his elder brother Rama. The genealogies differ so much in the names, number of persons, and order of succession, that without a very careful examination of all that is to be found concerning each person, little reliance can be placed on the particulars, although it is evident, that these genealogies have been taken from some common source; and I have no doubt, that a careful examination would enable the intelligent antiquary to remove many difficulties and contradictions, that now appear.
Far from the princes of Ayodhya having enjoyed an uninterrupted succession of supreme power for numerous ages, and from father to son, very few of them would appear to have been Chhatradharis, or lords paramount of India; and there is even reason to suspect, that the family at different periods was subject to great disasters, and repeatedly lost the dominion of even Kosala. The learned of Ayodhya informed the Pandit of the Mission, that their city had been three times destroyed, and that on these occasions all the people were carried to heaven with their Rajas Harischandra, Ambarisha, and Rama. The successors of these princes again collected people to occupy the city. The Pandits, whom I have employed, have not been able to trace the passages in which the two first catastrophes are mentioned; but the third is known to every one. Several traditions, however, that I have heard, confirm the opinion of Harischandra having been expelled from Ayodhya, as he is said to have removed the seat of government to Ellora, while his son Rohitaswa lived at Rautas, and his grandson founded Champa, at Bhagulpoor in Bengal. That Ambarisha also met with some misfortune is probable; as in the Sri Bhagwat, he is not succeeded by his son, and the line is carried on by Sindhudwipa, his brother, while in the Bangsalata, his immediate successor is Ritaparna, who, according to the Sri Bhagwat was the grandson of Sindhudwipa, and until the time of Ritaparna it is probable that the family did not recover from its misfortune. The severe treatment of his wife Sita, is said to have induced that princes to excite her sons to rebel against their father Rama, and this, more probably than his piety, sent him and his adherents to heaven. Ayodhya, however, was rebuilt by the son Kusha, who left a numerous offspring, that held the until the reign of Vrihadbala. From Vaiwaswata to Rama inclusive, the Sri Bhagwat reckons 55 princes, the Mahabharat reckons 69, and the Bangsalata 78; but the Ramayana of Valmika reckons only 36. This being it is supposed by far the most ancient account, is probably the most correct, and we may suppose it to be free from the interpolations of collateral successions and dynasties introduced by later writers, and to be the actual succession of the kings of Ayodhya; unfortunately Valmiki gives no list of Rama's successors and the Purans, as usual, are filled with numerous discordance. Vrihadbala, killed by Abhimanaya in the great war at the commencement of the iron age, was one of the most remarkable successors of Rama. According to the Sri Bhagwat, he was the 27th descent from Rama. In the Mahabharat he is the 33rd, and in the Bangsalata he is the 25th. As, owing to similar causes these numbers are probably as much increased as the predecessors of Rama, the number of princes, taking the scale of the Sri Bhagwat reduced by that of Valmiki as a guide, from Rama to Vrihadbala may have been 17, or from the commencement of the silver to the commencement of the iron age, 53 princes, which, they were also generations of 3 to a century, would give a duration of 1766 years. There is no impossibility in admitting such a duration; but I think, as I have said, that in all probability it must be reduced. Major Wilford (table in 5th Vol. of Asiatic Researches ) has found in the Purans. 59 princes from the time of Rama to that of Chandragupta, contemporary nearly with Alexander. Reducing these by the scale of Rama's predecessors, we shall have 31 princes, which added to Rama and his predecessors, will give in all 67 princess, if these commenced their government 1366 years before Christ and ended it 300 years before this event, there will be on an average about 15 ½ years for each prince which can only be understood of reigns, and not of generations. On these grounds, Vaiwaswata being placed in the year before Christ, 1366, Rama will be placed in 775, and Vrihadbala, or the commencement of the historical iron age in the year
512. But, if the antiquary prefers with Major Wilford to consider these 67 as generations, we must double the length of each period; that is, we must say, that Ayodhya was founded 2732 years before Christ, that Rama flourished 1550 years before that event, and that Vrihadbala was killed in the 1024.
It must be observed, that in the Purans, little amplification seems to have been made in the family of the moon, as from Budha, one generation after Vaiwaswata to Krishna, contemporary with Vrihadbala, the Sri Bhagwat reckons 55 persons, a difference of only two persons from that which is given by the correction that is required in the list of the family of the sun, by comparing Valmiki with the Sri Bhagwat; and this coincidence, I consider as in a great measure proving, that the nature of the correction which I have adopted is not subject to material error, so far as relates to the number of successions; but it decides nothing as to the points of whether we are to consider these as reigns or as generations.
The people of Ayodhya imagine, that after the death of Vrihadbala, their city was deserted, and continued so until the time of Vikrama of Ujjain, who came in search of the holy city, erected a fort called Ramgar, cut down the forests by which the ruins were covered, and erected 360 temples on the places sanctified by the extraordinary actions of Rama, of his wife Sita, of his brother Lakshman, and of his General Mahavira. The only foundation probably for such a tradition is, that Vikrama may have erected some temples, and that in the Mahabharata the genealogy of the family it continued no lower than the time of Vrihadbala, as being foreign to the subject of the book; but in the Sri Bhagwat Vrihadbala is succeeded by 29 princes, and in the Bangsalata by 24. These, taken according to the scales of Ramas predecessors in Valmiki and the Sri Bhagwat, would give 18 princes, and this will give us 279, or 558 years, according as we call these successions reigns or generations, brining the existence of the family down to the time nearly of Alexander; but none of the latter princes rose to considerable power, and they were vassals of the Kings of Magadha. Their existence, however, throws a great doubt on the whole story concerning Vikrama.
This Vikrama is usually suppose to have been the personage from which the era called Sambat is derived, and, according to the reckoning used in Kosala, this era commences 57 years before the birth of Christ, so that the city had been then deserted about 280 years. How the places remarkable for the actions of the God could be traced after such a long interval, and amidst the forest, seems rather doubtful; and the doubt will be increased, if it supposed that they latter Vikarama, the son in law of the Emperor Bhoja, was the person who constructed the temples at Ayodhya. This I am inclined to think was probably the case, for although Rama was probably worshipped before the time of elder Vikrama, yet his worship as that peculiarly distinguishing a sect of begots, seems to have been first established by Ramanuja about the time of the latter Vikrama, who may from thence be supposed peculiarly eager to discover the traces of the deity of his own sect. Unfortunately if these temples ever existed, not the smallest trace of them remains to enable us to judge of the period when they were built; and the destruction is very generally attributed by the Hindus to the furious zeal of Aurangzebe, to whom also is imputed the overthrow of the temples in Benares and Mathura. What may have been the case in the two latter, I shall not now take upon myself to say, but with respect to Ayodhya the tradition seems very ill founded. The begot by whom the temples were destroyed is said to have erected mosques on the situations of the most remarkable temples; but the mosque at Ayodhya, which by far the most entire, and which has every appearance of being the most modern, is ascertained by an inscription on its walls (of which a copy is given) to have been built by Babur, five generations before Aurangzebe. This renders the whole story of Vikrama exceedingly doubtful, specially as what are said to be the ruins of his fort, do not in any essential degree differ from those said to have belong to the ancient city, that is consist entirely of irregular heaps of broken bricks, covered with soil, and remarkably productive of tobacco; and, from its name, Ramgar, I am inclined to suppose that is was a part of the building actually erected by Rama.
Although I did not fail to visit the place, and whatever the Hindus reckon remarkable, I did not choose to take any measurements, so as to draw with any accuracy of plan of the space which the ruins occupy, as the doing so might have given offence to government of the Nawab Vazir, in whose territory, separated from this district only by the river Sarayu, they are situated.
I may in a general manner observe, that the heaps of bricks, although much seems to have been carried away by the river, extend a great way, that is, more than a mile in length, and more than half a mile in width; and that although vast quantities of materials have been removed to built the Muhammedan Ayodhya or Fyzabad, yet the ruins in many parts retain a very considerable elevation; nor is there any reason to doubt, that the structure to which they belong, has been very great; when we consider, that it has been ruined for above 2000 years. None of the Hindu buildings at present existing are in the least remarkable either for size or architecture, and they are all not only evidently, but avowedly, quite modern, that is, they have been all erected since the reign of Aurangzebe, or most of them even within the memory of man. Although they are built on what I have no doubt are the ruins of the palace that was occupied by the princes of the family of the sun, their being built on the spots, where the events which they are intended to celebrate, actually happened, would have been extremely doubtful, even had the elder Vikrama built temples on the various places which had been destroyed by Aurangzebe, so that the spots selected by Vikrama might be known by tradition; but the whole of that story being liable to strong suspicion, we may consider the present appropriation of names to different places as no better founded than the miracles, with several of them are said to commemorate.
It is said that in digging for bricks many images have been discover, but the few which I was able to trace were too much broken to ascertain what they were meant to represent, except one at the convent (Akhara) of Guptar, where Lakshman supposed to have disappeared. This represents a man and women carved on one stone. The latter carries somewhat on her head, and neither has any resemblance to what I have before seen. The only thing except these two figures and the bricks, that could with probability be traced to the ancient city, are some pillars in the mosques built by Babur. These are of black stone, and of an order which I have seen nowhere else, and which will be understood from the accompanying drawing. That they have been taken from a Hindu building, is evident, from the traces of images being observable on some of their bases; although the images have been cut off to satisfy the conscience of the begot. It is possible that these pillars have belonged to a temple built by Vikrama; but I think the existence of such temples doubtful; and, if they did not exist, it is probable that the pillars were taken from the ruins of the palace. They are only 6 feet high. There is a Shiva Lingga called Nageshwar, which is called on by all the pilgrims to witness their faith, when they have performed the usual ceremonies; and this supposed to be the oldest image of the place. As Lakshman the brother of Rama is supposed to have founded one of the orders of Yogis, there is a probability that the great God was a principal object of worship at the court of his brother, and this image may actually have then existed, as from its form, if kept from the weather, it may have lasted from the first origin of things; but it leads to no conclusions, and may be of very modern date. Could we believe what is said of the chief objects of worship now at the place, they would be of singular curiosity. They are images said to the present Rama, Lakshman, and Sita, made by the first personage, and thrown by him into the Sarayu, when he was about to proceed on an expedition to the Indus. In modern times they were divulged to a fortunate merchant by the ordinary course of dreaming. He drew them from the river, and built temple for them, which was destroyed by Aurangzebe, but the images were allowed to escape, and Ahilya, the widow of Holkar, lately built for them a small temple, which is only opened at peculiar times, and only to the faithful. Sitting aside the dream, the escape of the images from Aurangzebe, as they are made of gold, renders the story very problematical. They are about a span high, and were so covered with flowers, and shown in so dark a place, that my people who went to worship could form no opinion either as to their shape or materials.
I procured a good many old copper coins, and many were said to be of the Hindu Kings; but on examination, except two, all appear to contain Arabic inscriptions, but in very old characters, and I had similar ones at Agra. One said to have been found in the Sarayu retains a defaced figure in the human form; and another the figure of a lion. These are probably Hindu coins, but they contain no legend, nor anything to indicate that they belonged to princes of the family of the sun.
The person who finally expelled the family of the sun from Ayodhya, is not stated by tradition, nor, so far as I can learn, in legend, but the learned of this district have heard of the dominion of the Cheros, although this impure tribe has here left no monuments of its power, the place being far removed from the seat of government." (pages 325-337) 1601. What is apparent from the above report of Martin is that he was the first person to tell us about inscriptions on the wall of the disputed building to say that it was built by Babar. We have also noticed that Buchanan must have visited the area between 1807 to 1814, i.e. after about 280 years (if the disputed building was constructed by Babar in 1528 AD). Martin however, has observed that the building appears to be most modern. He also found that locally the people said that after destructing a temple, the Mosque was constructed by Aurangzeb. It is difficult to believe that till 1807 there was no Hindu person capable of reading and writing Persian or Arabic, as the case may be, to find out what was written in the said inscriptions in the Mosque and to tell others that the disputed building was actually constructed by Babar. Buchanan also does not appear to have actually visited the disputed building in order to collect the details as is evident from the next para that he did not do so (collect measurement) for the reason that it might have offended the Government of Nawab Vazir. We may notice hereat that upto 1814 and even thereafter, the entire area of Avadh was within the sovereignty of Nawab Vazir of Lucknow though for some part of defence etc. Nawab Vazir has entered into a treaty with East India Company in 1801 but only the area which was in the territory of Banaras was within the authority of East India Company and rest of the part, particularly Avadh, was not within the reigning territory of East India Company. The text of the alleged inscriptions, the number of inscriptions etc. are not mentioned in the report. The language, however, shows that there was only one inscription which could be seen by Buchanan. The text of the inscription, as existed when Buchanan visited Ayodhya between 1807 to 1814, has not been placed before us in an authentic manner though plaintiffs (Suit-
5) has sought to rely on a text of the inscription which he claims to have collected from British Museum but the same having not been proved in accordance with Evidence Act, we find it difficult to place any reliance thereon. Even if we place reliance thereon, nothing helps us to form an opinion that the building in dispute was actually constructed in 1528 by Mir Baqi under the command of Babar.
1602. The affidavit dated 17th December, 1999 was filed by Sri Deoki Nandan Agarwala plaintiff no.3 (Suit-5) where in para 3, 4 and 5 he said:
"3. That the English documents written in hand script prevalent in the past and Persian/Arabic and Nustalik annexures thereto were obtained by Vishwa Hindu Parishad, New Delhi through the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (U.K.) during the course of negotiations for resolving the tangle relating to the Sri Rama Janma Bhumi, by mutual dialogue through the mediation of the then Prime Minister of India in the year 1992, from the British Library where the original manuscript of the document is lodged. The original leter from the General Secretary of the VHP U.K. Dated 23 Sept. 1992 to the VHP New Delhi is also being filed with this affidavit.
4. That the documents obtained from the British Library U.K. are not available anywhere else and appear to be unpublished. The originals cannot be moved from the Library and cannot therefore be produced. Their copies supplied by the Library are thus admissible in evidence.
5. That the documents in English are in old style hand written script of the early nineteenth century, with which I am well acquainted. I have deciphered them and made a typescript of the same, which is also being filed. I say that the type script of the handwritten documents in English is a correct copy of the same."
1603. The letter dated 23rd September, 1992 referred to in para 3 of the aforesaid affidavit appears to have been sent by one Sri Kishor Ruparelia- Gen. Sec. 48 Wharfedale Gardens, Thornton Heath, Surrey UK addressed to Sri Jashwant Rai Gupta, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Sankat Mochan Ashram, New Delhi. The relevant extract thereof is as under:
"I am sending herewith photocopies, obtained from the British Library, of the following documents kept under Ref MSS. EUR. E73 and filed as records by Dr Buchanan
1. Pages 1 & 2, written by Dr. Buchanan, heading:

1604. This letter is paper No.189C2/3. Paper No.189C2/4-5 appears to be translation of some Persian or Arabic words by somebody at Gorakhpur. In respect to the period Paper no.189C2/4-5 the following extract refers to AH935.
"N.B. The words ‫ بود خیر باقی‬signifying "There is lasting charity" or "good works are lasting" also mean "the charity of Baqee" and form an anagram of the year of the erection viz : 935."
1605. Thereafter paper no.189C2/8-9 contains the Persian or Arabic text to which we are not clear as to whether it is in respect to the inscriptions said to be fixed on the building in dispute or else.

The English translation (interpretation) of the aforesaid verses (though incomplete) has been given in paper no. 189C2/10-11, which has also been checked by the Court since one of us fortunately is conversant in Persian and Urdu. It reads as under:

Nustalick writing We are informed by the ancients who were acquainted with the these facts that there was formerly a Prince named Tugli Khan Oimyeed throne. His Wuzeer had a daughter betrothed to Moosa Ashiquan. (Lit. The comforter of Lovers). After some time the Wuzeer departed from this dwelling of mortality to the abode of Eternity. --
The king having sent written orders for the purpose of sezing the property in the Wuzeer's house; at that moment Moosa Ashiqan was struck with the reflection that "This World is nothing". He gave orders that all the people should plunder and carry off whatever money and effects were in his house' - The people did as he directed. As soon as the plundering was over, he enquired whether anything remained. The attendants told him that there remained some grain. He directed them to carry off that also. After this he again made enquiry, if anything was yet left. The servants replied that there was only a piece of coarse canvas or Taut, upon which the horses were wont to eat their gram". "That" said he "will be of use to me". In short having taken and torn althrough the middle and threw it over his shoulders (or neck) he became a Durwish. --
Babur one of the Princes, hearing the report of his becoming a Durwish and the other circumstances, privately presented himself before his Highness. Beholding the wretched condition of Babur, he gave him some sweetmeats to eat and (addressing him) "Thou", said his Highness" shalt be King "Babur arose and having made his Salam, was departing. His Highness again said "I am annoyed by the Hindoos who are constantly ringing their Bells- When thou becomest King thou shalt build a Musjid at this place.
Sometime afterwards Babur mounting the royal throne was created King; but forgot His Highness's directions. Moosa Ashiqan sending a person from himself reminded him of it. Upon this the Soobadar received His Majoxty's commands--Meer Buqaoola Khan then Soobedar, and he erected this Massjid."
1607. Sri Ravi Shankar, Senior Advocate, Sri P.N.Mishra, Sri Hari Shankar Jain, Sri R.L.Verma, Advocates, learned counsels for Hindu parties sought to refer to the above documents to show that this is the extract of the report and documents of Dr. Buchanan himself and makes it very clear that the building in dispute was constructed much later what is being claimed as it contains the name of Emperor Alamgir (Aurangzab) also. As we have already said, the above documents were not proved by the concerned party and a properly obtained document from British Library, Oriental and India Office Collections has also not been produced. It is therefore difficult for us to place any reliance on the said documents.
1608. The worship of places by Hindus, however, has been noticed in the History, Antiquities, Topography And Statistics of Eastern India (supra) published in 1838. In Vol. I at page 195, Martin has observed:
"It must be observed, that the Hindus very often worship (Puja) without any temple or images. ... There are places, however, that are reckoned more holy than the house..."
1609. The long passage we have quoted from several pages of Martin's Eastern India, Vol. II above has some reason. We have no bias or prejudice against the agents of East India Company or the then British Government, but the manner in which they have dealt with the Indian ancient scriptures and have written down about its culture, religion, society etc. needs some deeper consideration. In fact, the history of India, which is substantially embodied in ancient religious scriptures, has been initially attempted to be penned down by the western writers after advent of East India Company. In 18th and 19th century a mass of work has been undertaken by them which has aroused anxiety and has drawn attention of the people abroad to know more about India. Before making further comments, one thing which is a matter of appreciation, we cannot forget is that whatever was written by western so called intelligentsia mainly in the two centuries as said above, at least has given a foundation or a point of commencement to others, whether in India or outside, to go for further research in the matter and endeavour to place the correct history of this sub-continent before the world at large.
1610. The ancient scriptures in India was basically written in Sanskrit irrespective of the script. It was not a language of the common man. Therefore, virtually substantial section of the sub-continent comprising Hindustan at that time was in dark about the contents, meaning and the message derivable from those scriptures. It was confined to a particular class, i.e., Brahmans and there also a very few were learned having some deeper knowledge of those scriptures, otherwise general class was more satisfied with the superficial working knowledge sufficient for their day to day earning and survival. 1611. The East India Company after its initial few steps towards India, brought such a huge revenue to England that the people thereat were simply stunned and shocked to find out as to how this part of the Country could muster such a huge wealth. Another surprising aspect was that the Indian sub-continent was under the attack/invasion by outsiders for almost a thousand and more years in the past and had continuously been looted by them. Massive wealth continuously was driven off from the Country, yet when the merchant companies of Britishers in the form of East India Company visited India, in the first one and half decade i.e. upto 1613, it showed remarkable earning to their shareholders and public at large in England. This created great anxiety amongst the Britishers to know more about India. It also inspired other European Countries as we have seen that almost simultaneously the merchant ships travelled India through sea routes from the Countries like Portugal, France and England obvious. Trade from India to other Countries, i.e. Africa, Arab, China etc. had been going on since long and time immemorial as a result whereof merchants were able to garner extraordinary wealth by exporting several things like spices, sandalwood etc. from India. Besides fertile land of this Country also help in producing wealth. They also found that amongst the Hindus, age old traditions, religious faith carried down from generations to generations from time immemorial and had not got diluted despite several religious attacks, conversions, etc. All these things, which were really surprising, aroused lot of anxiety amongst the Europeans to know more about this Country. 1612. According to their concept, the oldest culture in the world was Roman and Greek and they knew nothing more than that. It was really difficult for them to believe that a much more advanced and that too more ancient culture could have existed in this part of the world for such a long time and has successfully faced all bad times to survive while the Roman and Greek culture has perished long back. With this idea lots of people from Europe came to India and tried to find out the source of its cultural and religious history from the written work whatever was available. Since, the work was mainly in Sanskrit, thus the written material was also available with the selected Brahmans. Several kinds of manuscripts they possessed which were collected by these western people in one or other way. They tried to find out in their own way the most authenticated and original manuscripts on the subject concerned. A language, a culture which was several thousands and more years old, it is surprising that these western intelligentsia class claim to have learnt and understood and that too achieved mastery. They dealt with the above collected material in their own way. Without making any serious comment on this aspect, suffice to mention that the spirit, the context of real intention of a culture which has developed in several thousand years is improbable, if not impossible, to be understood in such a short time. Even today those who are constantly studying and dealing with those matters, are still undergoing rigorous discussion, research and investigation to understand the correct and real intention behind the particular words, sentences, phrases and verses, as the case may be.
1613. The only thing which we really find commendable is that the zeal of the western intelligentsia to know more about the Indian ancient culture brought out the ancient literature from the confines of the Brahmans and as a result of its translation in English and other languages, the things became accessible to the entire lot so that they may also look into the matter, ponder over it so as to appreciate and understand. In fact this translation attracted the world people to go for more indepth research, discoveries and investigation and that is how the things started and today in 21st century we find several new and startling facts which belie a lot of settled concepts of the western writers of 18th or 19th century.
1614. The casual manner in which the long genealogy covering a very long period was found inconceivable by these writers and has been shortened at their whims and conjectures only because they could not have a complete chain is really startling. It means that if I am unable to tell the chain of my ancestors to five or seven or ten generations, that would mean that I have no such past chain of generation or it can be reduced to the extent of missing part. Non-availability does not mean non existent. No one can accept that merely because somebody could not give the detail of past generations, that would mean that he has no such ancestry. The casual and contemptuous manner in which Dr. Buchanan or Martin in the above work, i.e., Eastern India (supra) have dealt with the things we have quoted give a few example. If some needs a little more can be demonstrated from page 433 and onwards, some part of which we may notice hereunder :
"The highest science is here reckoned the theology of the Vedas, which is more studied, than would appear from the reports of the Pandit of the survey, who like other Bengalese holds this science, if such it can be called, in great contempt. The doctrines of Sangkara are chiefly followed; and the works most commonly studied are the Vedantasar, composed by a pupil of Awaitananda, a Brahman of the south, who dedicated his life to religion;
the Pangchadasi, and the ten Upanishad Bhashyas of Sangkara. The theologians here insist, that every word, sentence and verse in the Vedas, as they now exist, was formed by Brahma before the earth, and that Vyasa did not alter a syllable; but only arranged the original parts into four books, which previously had been comprehended in one. All mention therefore of events, that have happened since the creation, is supposed to be prophetical. Such, I believe, is the opinion, that very generally prevails among the Brahmans of the south, as well as those here; and, having been communicated to the learned in Europe, was supposed by them to imply, that the books now called the Vedas were the work of a great lawgiver named Brahma, who formed the laws of the Hindu nation, and introduced science. When it was discovered, that these works mentioned many personages, who lived very long after the commencement of the Hindu government, as the power of prophecy could not be received by any one but a Hindu, it was justly concluded, that they were not the works of the lawgiver Brahma, who in fact is a mere creature of imagination; and Mr. Pinkerton is fully justified in calling the Vedas modern forgeries, even had Mr. Colebrooke proved that they were written by Vyasa, and that Vyasa lived 12 centuries before the birth of Christ; for in comparison of the commencement of the Hindu history, before which the Vedas are alleged to have been written, even this distant period of Vyasa is but as yesterday. But that the Vedas, which now exist, were written by Vyasa the son of Parasara, or so early, seems to me completely incompatible with the mention made in them of the success, that had attended the ceremony used at the coronation of Janmejaya the son of Parikshita, by which he had conquered the world; for Janmejaya was grandson of Abhimanya, who was the great grandson of Vyasa the son of Parasara, and it is altogether impossible, that so remote an ancestor should live to celebrate the conquest of the world by his descendant. But besides this conquest is not likely to have been mentioned by any contemporary author; for in all probability the supreme government of India was not then vested in the spurious offspring of Vyasa, but in the house of Jarasandha. Mr. Colebrooke indeed states, that besides the descendant of Vyasa he has heard from the Brahmans of another Janmejaya son of Parikshita; but on a careful examination of the genealogies, extracted from the Purans by Manogyadatta, I can find no such person; nor can that learned Pandit recollect any such, although there are many Janmejayas, especially the son of Puru, kind of Pratishthan, and the names are so alike, that they may readily have misled the Pandits consulted by Mr. Colebrooke, speaking from recollection. If a Vyasa, therefore, was author of the present Vedas, it was not the son of Parasara, but some person, who probably lived shortly before Sangkara Acharya; and many in fact allege, that the instructor of this great doctor was named Vyasa. If so, the author, or compiler, or perhaps rather corrupter of the Vedas, lived about the ninth or tenth century of the Christian era, in the age emphatically called dark, and to judge from the account given of the Vedas by Mr. Colebrooke, the work is worthy of the age.
It is probable, however, that before this time, there existed a system of science (Veda), extending, according to a passage quoted by Mr. Colebrooke, not only to the four kinds of sacred knowledge, detailed in the present Vedas, but to grammar and history, the first of which in the passage alluded to is called the chief of the (Vedas) sciences, although the books now called Vedas do not treat on the subject. The historical part, there is reason to think, was valuable; but being irreconcilable with doctrines, which the author wished to establish, was totally new modelled in separate works called the Purans. Although all these go under the name of Vyasa, there is certain grounds to doubt of his having composed the whole, as it seems scarcely possible, that any one man in his senses would attempt to pass on the credulity of mankind a number of books, treating on the same subject in manners totally discordant and contradictory, as happens in these works. Many circumstances mentioned in these Purans, would show the time in which Vyasa actually lived, could any of these works be traced with certainty to him; and I suspect, that not only the historical part (Purana) of the ancient system of science, but that written by Vyasa has been new modelled in the various works now called Purans, all probably very modern, and composed by various persons." 1615. The long observations, we have just made are in the context of the fact that the Buchanan's survey relates to the earliest part of 19th century, i.e., 1807 to 1814. Aurangzeb died in 1707 after having ruled for about 50 years. Therefore, the memory of the people in respect to the incidents which took place during Aurangzeb were just 100 to 150 years old in comparison to that of Babar who was there about more than 275 years back. The people's memory is better reliable in respect to the recent incidents in comparison to ancient one. The belief of the local people about the destruction or construction at the disputed site, in the same way noticed by Tieffenthaler about 50 years back from the period of Buchanan and same thing noticed by Buchanan, in our view, ought to have been given more reliability than simply discarding the same on the basis of an inscription, the possibility whereof was always to be installed at any later point of time. In the absence of any material or anything to show that it was fixed almost 272 years back and the belief of the local people was perverse, we find it difficult to rely only on the observations of Buchanan based on inscriptions, the language whereof was not known to him and there is nothing to show that he could read or understood it. 1616. Sri P.N. Mishra, learned counsel further submitted that had the building in dispute constructed in 1528 and that too at the command of Emperor Babar, it would be inconceivable that Abul Fazal Allami in his work "Ain-e-Akbari" would have failed to notice the same though, if correct, it would have been the work of Akbar's grandfather. He refers to the "Ain-e- Akbari" written by Abul Fazal Allami, translated in English by H. Blochmann edited by Leiut. Colonel D.C. Phillott, first published 1927-1949 reprint 1989 published by Low Price Publications, Delhi. He pointed out that Abul Fazal Allami has referred to "Ayodhya" and its religious importance for Hindus and also certain religious places of Muslims. Therefore, it is improbable that he would have missed or ignored to mention about a grand mosque constructed by grandfather of Emperor Akbar though has mentioned about other places of Ayodhya. This shows that till the date when the aforesaid work was written by Abul Fazal, building in dispute had not came into existence and it is incorrect to suggest that it was constructed in 1528 AD. He explained that this is the reason why we do not find any such mention in the work of Goswami Tulsidas, a great follower of Lord Ram. From Volume 1 of "Ain-e-Akbari", Sri P.N.Mishra placed certain extracts from page 162 and onwards to show that a large number of places of worship were constructed in 983 AH and onwards (see page 179, "Ain-e- Akbari") and that tax levelled on non-Muslims was abolished in 987 AH. About the abolition of tax on non-Muslims, page 198 of "Ain-e-Akbari" Vol.-1 quote as under :
"In this year the Tamgha (inland tolls) and the Jazya (tax on infidels), which brought in several krors of dam were abolished, and edicts to this effect were sent over the whole empire."
1617. He also referred to pages 201, 202 and 203 to show that the policy of Akbar was not so fanatic and was judicious to Hindus also. Had there been such a construction at the religious place of Hindus, the Akbar would have allowed it to be removed. The various orders and actions as noticed by Allami in "Ain-e-Akbari" Vol.-1 on pages 201 and onwards are as under:
"His majesty was now [990] convinced that the Millenium of the Islamitio dispensation was drawing near.
No obstacle, therefore, remained to promulgating the design which he had planned in secret. The Shaykhs and Ulamas who, on account of their obstinacy and pride, had to be entirely discarded, were gone, and His Majesty was free to disprove the orders and principles of the Islam, and to ruin the faith of the nation by making new and absurd regulations. The first order which was passed was that the coinage should show the era of the Millenum, and that a history of the one thousand years should be written, but commencing from the death of the Prophet. Other extraordinary innovation were devised as political expedients, and such orders were given that one's senses got quite perplexed. Thus the sijda, or prostration, was ordered to be performed as being proper for kings; but instead of sijda, the word zaminbos was used. Wine also was allowed, if used for strengthening the body, as recommended by doctors; no mischief or impropriety was to result from the use of it, and strict punishments were laid down for drunkenness, or gatherings and uproars. ....
"Beef was interdicted, and to touch beef was considered defiling. The reason of this was that, from his youth, His Majesty had been in company with Hindu liberation, and had thus learnt to look upon a cow- which in their opinion is one of the reasons why the world still exists- as something holy. Besides the Emperor was subject to the influence of the numerous Hindu princess of the Harem, who had gained so great ascendancy over him as to make his forswear beef, garlic, onion, and the wearing of a beard, which things His majesty still avoids. He had also introduced, though modified by his peculiar views, Hindu customs and heresies into the court assemblies, and introduces them still, in order to please and win the Hindus and their castes; he abstained from everything which they think repugnant to their nature, and looked upon shaving the beard as the highest sign of friendship and affection for him. Hence this custom has become very general. Pandering pimps also expressed the opinion that the beard takes its nourishment from the testicles; for no eunnch had a beard; and one could not could exactly see of what merit or importance it was to cultivate a beard.
Moreover, former ascetics and looked upon carelessness in letting the beard grow as one way of mortifying one's flesh, because such carelessness exposed them to the reproach of the world; and so, at present, the silly lawyers of the Islam looked upon cutting down the beard as reproachful, it was clear that shaving was now a way of mortifying the flesh, and therefore praiseworthy, but not letting the beard grow. (But if any one considers this argument calmly, he will soon detect the fallacy.) Lying, cheating Muftis also quoted an unknown tradition, in which it was stated that 'some Qasis' of Persia had shaved their beards. But the words ka-ma gaf alu ba'z' 'l-quzdt (as some Qasis have done), which occur in this tradition, are based upon a corrupt reading, and should be ka-ma yaf 'a' u ba l-gusat (as some wicked men have done). . .
"The ringing of bells as in use with the Christians, and the showing of the figure of the cross, and . . . . . . and other childish anything of theirs; were daily in practice. The words Kufr shay shud, or 'heresy' 'became common', express the Tdrikh (985). Ten or twelve years after the commencement of these doings, matters had gone so far that wretches like Mirza Jani, chief of Tattah, and other apostates, wrote their confessions on paper as follows :- 'I, such a one, son of such a one, have willingly and cheerfully renounced and rejected the Islam in all its phases, whether low or high, as I have witnessed it in my ancestors and have joined the Divine Faith of Shah Akbar, and declare myself willing to sacrifice to him my property and life, my honour and religion'. And these papers- there could be no more effective letters of damnation- were handed over to the Mujtahid ( Abu'l Fazl) of the new creed, and were considered a source of confidence or promotion. The Heavens might have parted as under, and earth might have opened her abyss and the mountains have crumbled to dust! "In opposition to the Islam, pigs and dogs were no longer looked upon as unclean. A large number of these animals was kept in the Harem, and in the vaults of the castle, and to inspect them daily was considered a religious exercise. The Hindus, who believe in incarnations, said that the boar belonged to the ten forms which God Almighty had once assumed.
"God is indeed Almighty- but not what they say." "The saying of some wise men that a dong had ten virtues, and that a man, if he possesses one of them, was saint, was also quoted as a proof. Certain courtiers and friends of His Majesty, who were known for their excellence in every department, and proverbial as court poets, used to put dogs on a tablecloth and feed them, whilst other heretical poets. Persians and Hindustanis, followed this example, even taking the tongues of dogs into their own mouths, and then boasting of it.
"Tell the Mir that thou hast, within thy skin, a dog and a carcass.
"A dog runs about in front of the house; don't make him a messmate.
"The ceremonial ablution after emission of semen was no longer considered binding, and people quoted as proof that the essence of man was the sperma genitale, which was the origin of good and bad man. It was absurd that voiding urine and excrements should not require ceremonial ablutions, whilst the emission of so tender a fluid should necessitate ablution; it would be far better, if people would first bathe, and then have connexion.
"Further, it was absurd to prepare a feast in honour of a dead person; for the corpse was mere matter, and could derive no pleasure from the feast. People should therefore make a grand feast on their birthdays. Such feasts were called Ash i haydt, food of life.
"The flesh of a wild boar and the tiger was also permitted, because the courage which these two animals possess would be transferred to any one who fed on such meat.
"It was also forbidden to marry one's cousins or near relations, because such marriages are destructive of mutual love. Boys were not to marry before the age of 16, nor girls before 14, because the offspring of early marriages was weakly. The wearing of ornaments and silk dresses at the time of prayer was made obligatory.
"The prayers of the Islam, the fast, nay even the pilgrimage, were henceforth forbidden. Some bastards, as the son of Mulla Mubarak, a worthy disciple of Shaykh Abu'l Fazl wrote treatises, in order to revile and ridicule our religious practices, of course with proofs. His Majesty liked such productions, and promoted the authors.
"The era of the Hijrah was now abolished, and a new era was introduced, of which the first year was the year of the emperor's accession (963). The months had the same names as at the time of the old Persian kings, and as given in the Nisab" 's.sibniyan'. Fourteen festivals also were introduced, corresponding to the feasts of the Zoroastrians; but the feasts of the Musalmans, and their glory were trodden down, the Friday prayer alone being retained because some old, decrepit, silly people used to go to it. The new era was called Tdrikh I llahi, or 'Divine Era'. On copper coins and gold muhrs, the era of the Millennium was used, as indicating that the end of the religion of Muhammad, which was to last one thousand years, was drawing near. Reading and learning Arabio was looked upon as a crime; and Muhammadan law, the exegesis of the Quran, and the Tradition, as also those who studied them, were considered bad and deserving of disapproval. Astronomy, philosophy, medicine, mathematics, poetry, history and novels, were cultivated and thought necessary. Even the letters which are peculiar to the Arabic language, ّٰ as the ‫ث۔‬،‫ع‬،‫ح‬،‫ ص‬،‫ ض‬and ‫ ظ۔‬were avoided. Thus for ‫عببداللہ‬ ّٰ people wrote ‫ ابداللہ‬Abdullah; and for ‫ احدی‬Ahadi, ‫ اھد‬Ahadi etc. All this pleased His Majesty. Two verses from the Shahnama, which Firdawsi gives as part of a story, were frequently quoted at court-
From eating the flesh of camels and lizards The Arabs have made such progress, That they now wish to get hold of the kingdom of Persia.
Fie upon Fate! Fie upon Fate! "Similarly other verses were eagerly seized, if they conveyed a calumny, as the verses from the ..........., in which the falling out of the teeth of our prophet is alluded to.
"In the same manner, every doctrine and command of the Islam, whether special or general as the prophetship, the harmony of the Islam with reason, the doctrines of Ru yat, Taklif, and Takwin, the details of the day of resurrection and judgment- all were doubted and ridiculed. And if anyone did object to this mode of arguing, his answer was not accepted. But it is well known how little chance a man has who cite proofs against one who will reject them, especially when his opponent has the power of life and death in his hands; for equality in condition in a sine qud won in arguing." (Page 201-206) "Here Bada, on mentions the translations from Sanscrit into Persian, which have been alluded to above, p.110. It is not quite certain whether the translation were made from Sanscrit or from Hindi translations, or from both. Bada, on clearly states that for some translations, as at the Atharban, Hindus were used as interpreters. For other works as the Mahabharat, there may have been Hindi translations or extracts, because Akbar himself (vide p.111, note 2) translated passages to Naqib Khan. Abu'l-Fazl also states that he was assisted by Pandits when writing the fourth book of the A-in. Compare Sir H. Elliott's Index to the Historians of India, p. 259." (Page 209) "In these days (991) new orders were given. The killing of animals on certain days was forbidden as on Sundays, because this day is sacred to the Sun; during the first eighteen days of the month of Farwardin; the whole month of Ahan (the month in which His Majesty was born); and on several other days to please the Hindus. This order was extended over the whole realm, and capital punishment was inflicted on every one who acted against the command. Many a family was ruined. During the time of those fasts, His Majesty abstained altogether from meat, as a religious penance, gradually extending the several fasts during a year over six months and even more, with the view of eventually discontinuing the use of meat altogether." (Page 209-210) "In the same year (991) His Majesty built outside the town two places for feeding poor Hindus and Muhammadans, one of them being called Khayrpura and the other Dharmpura. Some of Abu'l-Fazl's people were put in charge of them. They spent His Majesty's money in feeding the poor. As an immense number of Jogis also flocked to this establishment, a third place was built, which got the name of Jogipura." (Page 210) "His Majesty once ordered that the Sunnis should stand separately from the Shiahs, when the Hindustanis, without exception, went to the Sunni side, and the Persians to the Shiah side." (Page 212) 1618. Vol. 2 "Ain-e-Akbari" Page 181 and onwards deals with "Oudh" and Sri Mishra placed the following part thereof :
"It is situated in the second climate. Its length from the Sarkar of Gorakhpur to Kanauj is 185 kos. Its breadth from the northern mountains to Sidhpur on the frontier of the Subah of Allahabad is 115 kos. To the east is Bihar; to the north, the mountains; to the south, Manikpur, and to the west Kanauj. Its climate is good. Summer and winter are nearly temperate. Its principal streams are the Saru (Sarju), the Ghaghar (Gogra) the Sai and the Godi (Gumti). In the first mentioned, divers aquatic animals and foms of strange appearance show themselves. Agriculture is in a flourishing state, especially rice of the kinds called Sukhdas, Madhkar, and Jhanwan, which for whiteness, delicacy, fragrance and wholesomeness are scarcely to be matched. They sow their rice three months earlier than in other parts of Hindustan. When the drought begins, the Sai and Gogra rise high in flood and before the beginning of the rains, the land is inundated, and as the waters rise, the stalks of rice shoot up and proportionately lengthen: the crop, however, is destroyed if the floods are in full force before the rice is in ear. Flowers, fruits and game are abundant. Wild buffaloes are numerous. When the plains are inundated the animals take to the high ground where the people find sport in hunting them. Some of the animals remain all day in the water and only at night approach the dry ground and breathe in freedom. Awadh (Ajodhya) is one of the largest cities of India. In is situated in longitude 118°, 0', and latitude 27°, 22'. It ancient times its populous site covered an extent of 148 kos in length and 86 in breadth, and it is esteemed one of the holiest places of antiquity. Around the environs of the city, they sift the earth and gold is obtained. It was the residence of Rama Chandra who in the Treta age combined in his own person both the spiritual supremacy and the kingly office.
At the distance of one kos from the city, the Gogra, after its junction with the Sai, [Saraju] flows below the fort.
Near the city stand two considerable tombs of six and seven yards in length respectively. The vulgar believe them to be the resting places of Seth and the prophet Job, and extraordinary tales are related of them. Some say that at Ratanpur is the tomb of Kabir, the assertor of the unity of God." (Page 181-182) 1619. The above contents are published on pages 170-172 of "Ain-e-Akbari" by Abul Fazal Allami, translated by Colonel H.S. Jarrett, Vol. 2, published in 1891 at Calcutta and the photocopy thereof alongwith its frontispiece has been filed as Exhibit T6 (Suit-4) (Paper No. 43A-1/25-28) (Register 18, pages 51-57).
1620. He also referred to the two footnotes one of which is with respect to Ram and another with respect to Sant Kabir and read as under : .
"The 7th avatar, who in this capital of the solar dynasty founded on the chariot wheel of Brahma, consummated the glories of sixty generations of solar princes and as the incarnate Rama, i.e. the hero of the famous epic that bears his name." (Page 182) "His doctrines were preached between A.D. 1380 and 1420 and attempted the union of Hindu and Muhammadan in the worship of one God whether invoked as Ali or Rama.
On his deceased both these sects claimed the body and while they contested it, Kabir suddenly stood in their midst and commanding them to look under the shoud, vanished. A heap of beautiful flowers was there discovered, which, divided among the rival worshippers, were buried or burnt according to their respective rites. Pilgrims from upper India to this day beg a spoonful of rice water from the Kabir Monastery at Puri in Orissa." (Page 182) 1621. He also pointed out to page 184 which gives certain other statistics of Oudh showing that main castes residing therein were "Brahmans" and "Kumbi". Then on page 311 of Vol. 2 Sri Mishra says that Abul Fazal has also taken note of various incarnations of Lord Vishnu in the form of Varahavatara or Boar-Incarnation, Nara-Sinha or Man-Lion Incarnation, Vamana or Dwarj-Incarnation, Parasurama or Incarnation of Ram with axe, then Ramavatara or Ram Incarnation, Krishnavatara or Incarnation as Krishna, Buddhavatara or Buddha Incarnation, Kalkyavatara or Kalki Incarnation. On pages 316-317, Ramavatara has been described as under :
"They relate that Ravana one of Rakshasas two generation in descent from Brahma, had ten heads and twenty hands. He underwent austerities for a period of ten thousand years in the Kailasa mountain and devoted his heads, one after another in this penance in the hope of obtaining the sovereignty of the three worlds. The deity appeared to him and granted his prayer. The gods were afflicted by his rule and as in the former instances, solicited his dethronement which was vouchsafed, and Rama was appointed to accomplish this end. He was accordingly born during the Treta Yuga on the ninth of the light half of the month of Chaitra (March-April) in the city of Ayodhya, of Kausalya wife of Raja Dasaratha. At the first dawn of intelligence, he acquired much learning and withdrawing from all worldly pursuits, set out journeying through wilds and gave a fresh beauty to his life by visiting holy shrines.
He became lord of the earth and slew Ravana. He ruled for eleven thousand years and introduced just laws of administration." (Page 316-317) 1622. Chapter IX Vol. 2 of "Ain-e-Akbari" deals with sacred places of pilgrimages and it includes a number of rivers as well as several places including Ayodhya as under :
"CHAPTER IX SACRED PLACES OF PILGRIMAGE Although profound and enlightened moralists are convinced that true happiness consists in the acquisition of virtue and recognise no other temple of God but a pure heart, nevertheless the physicians of the spiritual order, from their knowledge of the pulsation of human feeling, have bestowed on certain places a reputation for sanctity and thus rousing the slumberers in forgetfulness and instilling in them the enthusiastic desire of seeking God, have made these shrines instruments for their reverencing of the just, and the toils of the pilgrimage a means of facilitating the attainment of their aim.
These holy places are of four degrees.
The first is termed deva or divine and dedicated to Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadeva. The greatest among these are twenty-eight rivers in the following orders:- [P.177] (1) Ganges, (2) Sarasvati, (3) Jamuna, (4) Narbada, (5) Vipasa, Known as Biah (Hyphasis), (6) Vitasta (Hydaspes or Bidaspes) known as the Bihat, (7) Kausiki, a river near Rhotas in the Panjab, but some place it in the neighborhood of Garhi in the eastern districts (8) Nandavati (9) Chandrabhaga, known as the Chenab, (10) Sarayu (Sarju) known as the Sarau, (11) Satyavati, (12) Tapi known as Tapti upon the (north) bank of which is Burhanpur. (13) Paravati, (14) Pasavati (15) Gomati (Gumti) near Dvaraka. (16) Gandaki, upon the banks of which is Sultanpur of the Subah of Oudh, (17) Bahuda, (18) Devika (Deva or Gogra). (19) Godavari, called also Banganga. Pattan of the Dekhan is situated on its bank. (20) Tamraparni at the extremity of the Dekhan. Here pearls are found. (21) Charmanvati (22) Varana, near Benares (23) Iravti, known as the Ravi (Hydraotes), Lahor is on its bank. (24) Satadru (the hundred-Channelled), known as the Sutlej. Ludhiana is upon its bank. (25) Bhimarathi, [178] called also the Bhima, in the Dekhan. (26) Parnasona. (27) Vanjara, in the Dekhan, (28) Achamiyya, Some include the Indus, but it is not of the same sanctity.
Each of these rivers as dedicated to one of these deities, has peculiar characteristics ascribed to it: Some of the places situated on their banks are esteemed holy, as, for example, the village of Soron on the Ganges, to which multitudes flock on the twelfth of the month of Aghan (Nov- Dec). Some regard certain cities as dedicated to the divinities. Among these are Kasi, commonly called Benares. The Adjacent country for five kos around the city is held sacred. Although pilgrimages take place throughout the year, on the Siva-ratri multitudes resort thither from distant parts and it is considered one of the most chosen places in which to die. Final liberation is said to be fourfold: (1) Salokya passing from the degrees of paradise to Kailasa. They say that when a man goes to heaven through good works, he must return to earth, but when after various transmigrations, he attains that region, he returns no more (2) Sarupya (assimilation to the deity); when a man partakes of the divine elementary form, he does nor revisit the earth. (3) Samipya (nearness to the deity) is when a man after breaking the elemental bonds, by the power of good works is admitted into the presence of God's elect, and does not return to earth. (4) Sayuiya (absorption into the deity); after passing through all intermediate stages, he obtains the bliss of true liberation. They have likewise divided the territory of Benares into four kinds. The characteristic of two parts is that when a being dies therein, he attains the fourth degree of Mukti; if he dies in one of the others, he reaches the third degree, and if in the remaining one, the second degree.
Ayodhya, commonly called Awadh. The distance of forty kos to the east, and twenty to the north is regarded as sacred ground. On the ninth of the light half of the month of Chaitra a great religious festival is held.
Avantika, Ujjain. All around it for thirty-two kos is accounted holy and a large concourse takes place on the Siva-ratri.
Kanchi (Conjervaram) in the Dekhan. For twenty kos around it is considered sacred. On the eighth of every Hindu month that falls on a Tuesday, there is a great concourse of pilgrims.
Mathura is sacred for forty-eight kos around, and even before it became the birthplace of Krishna, was held in veneration. Religious festivals are held on the 23rd of the month of Bhadra (Aug-Sept) and the 15th of Karitika (Oct- Nov).
Duaraka. The country for forty kos in length and twenty in breadth is esteemed holy. On the Dlwalt festival, crowds resort hither.
Maya, known as Haridvra (Hardwar) on the Ganges. It is held sacred for eighteen kos in length. Large numbers of pilgrims assemble on the 10th of Chaitra. These seven are called the seven (sacred) cities.
Prayaga now called Illahabas. The distance for twenty kos around is venerated. They say that the desires of a man that dies here are gratified in his next birth. They also hold that whoever commits suicide is guilty of a great crime except in this spot where it meets with exceeding reward. Throughout the year it is considered holy, but especially so during the month of Magha (Jan-Fab).
Nagarkot For eight kos round it is venerated. On the eighth of the months of Chaitra and Kartika, many pilgrims assemble.
Kashmir is also accounted of this class and is dedicated to Mahadeva. Many places in it are held in great veneration.
The second are the shrines of the Asuras, which are temples dedicated to the Daitya race. In many things they share the privileges of the devatas; but the latter are more pure, while the others are filled with the principle of tamas (darkness). Their temples are said to be in the lower regions (Patala).
