                 Crl.M.C.No.3815 of 2010
               --------------------------

                         ORDER
Petitioner, the accused in L.P.No.6/1982 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kottarakkara, filed this petition under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure for a direction to the Magistrate to recall the non bailable warrant issued and to pass orders on the application for bail to be moved by the petitioner on the date of surrender.
2. When an accused, against whom a non bailable warrant is pending, surrenders and files an application for bail, Magistrate is expected to pass orders on the application without delay. I find no reason to believe that Magistrate is unaware of the provisions of law or the decisions of this Court or the Apex Court or that Magistrate will not act in accordance with law. Hence, no direction is warranted.
Petition is disposed.
