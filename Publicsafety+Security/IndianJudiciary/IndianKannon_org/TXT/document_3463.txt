Since the follow up action on most of the recommendations of the Committee was required to be taken by State Governments/UT Administrations, a copy of the report was circulated to all States/UTs for their comments and extension of time for furnishing of the Action taken Note was sought from the Hon’ble Committee.  The Hon’ble Committee kindly granted extension of time for submission of replies of the Ministry upto 6th June, 2005.

After examining the replies of the Government contained in the Action Taken Notes, the Hon’ble Standing Committee presented its 10th Report on implementation of Part IX A of the Constitution in Parliament on 2.8.2005. The Hon’ble Standing Committee in the 10th report has divided the Action Taken Notes on 26 recommendations contained in its Third Report into following categories:
         i) Recommendations  accepted by the Government      
(ii) Recommendations which the Committee would not like to  pursue in view of Government’s reply          
(iii) Recommendations in respect of which replies of the Government have not been accepted by the Committee       2.22)     The Action Taken Note of the Government on the recommendations contained in the Tenth Report of the committee was furnished to the Committee in February, 2006.
Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the Hon’ble Members that recommendations in respect of which the replies of the Governemnt have not been accepted by the Committee, the matter will be pursued with the State Governments/Uts concerned for speedy implementation.  Similarly, in respect of recommendations, which are accepted by the Government, further follow up action, wherever necessary, will be taken in due course of time.
Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the spirit of 74th Constitutional amendment my Ministry has taken several initiatives to strengthen the working of urban local bodies. The Status of implementation of the various recommendations contained in the Third and the Tenth Reports of the Committee is indicated in the Annexures I and II, respectively, to my Statement which is laid on the Table of the House.  I would not like to take the valuable time of the  House to read out all the contents of these Annexures.  I would request that this may be considered as read.
