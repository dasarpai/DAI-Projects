2. 24.06.2010
: This writ petition has been filed against the order dated 11.1.2010 passed by the Court of Special Regulation Officer, Ranchi in S.A.R. Case No. 44 of 2008-09 on the ground that the land in question is Chhapparbandi land.
Mr. Shivnath, learned senior counsel, appearing for the petitioner, referring to several documents annexed with this writ petition, submitted that the land in question is Chhapparbandi land and therefore a proceeding under Section 71A of the C.N.T. Act against such land is not maintainable.
In the impugned order it is, inter alia, observed that petitioner did not show anything about change of nature of land and as to by whom and when the nature of the land was changed into Chhapparbandi land.
In the facts and circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the impugned order. The petitioner is entitled to show everything before the authority concerned, who will pass orders in accordance with law.
The parties are directed to cooperate in early disposal of the matter and the authority will try to dispose of the same expeditiously and preferably within six months from the date of receipt/ production of a copy of this order.
With these observations and directions, this writ petition is disposed of.
(R. K. Merathia, J.) MK
