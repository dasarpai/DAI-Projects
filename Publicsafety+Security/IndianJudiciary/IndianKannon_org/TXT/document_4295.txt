Need To Allocate Sufficient Funds For Khurda-Bolangir Railway Line ... on 15 July, 2009
> Title : Need to allocate sufficient funds for Khurda-Bolangir railway line in Orissa.
  SHRI RUDRAMADHAB RAY (KANDHAMAL): Khurda-Bolangir Railway line project was sanctioned in 1994. It connects Western Orissa with the State Capital and covers four districts Nayagarh, Boudh, Sonpur and Bolangir districts. The total length of the Railway line is 279 kms, but the work has been started on 30 kms track only. Due to allocation of insufficient funds the work is going on at a very slow pace which has created lot of resentment among the people of Western Orissa. Since this line is their heart line, I urge upon the Government to allocate Rs. 250 crore in the budget of 2009-2010 for completion of this project by the year 2014-2015.
