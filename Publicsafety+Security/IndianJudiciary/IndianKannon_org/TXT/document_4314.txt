Ld. Counsel further submitted that in terms of the Notification No. 29/97-Cus. Dt. 1.4.1997 machinery for manufacture of textile garments which were exempted wholly both from the BCD as well as ACD and it is only in respect of machinery, which were not intended for textile garments. The notification authorised to levy ACD at concessional rate of 10% for goods imported under EPCG scheme. He further submitted that they had obtained EPCG licence for zero rate of duty both for BCD and ACD and the Customs Authorities cannot nullify this benefit. Therefore, he submits the findings of the lower authority that the knitting machine in question could not be considered as machine for manufacture of textile garment is not legal and proper.
