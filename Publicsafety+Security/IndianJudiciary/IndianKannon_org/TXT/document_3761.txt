2 9.12.2010 Heard learned counsel for the parties.
This writ application is dismissed on the solitary ground that the matter of this kind has already been decided by the various decisions, last of them a Division Bench decision in the case of State of Bihar & others vrs. Sohan Roy along with analogous cases reported in 2010(2) PLJR 397. If the petitioner comes within the ambit of the Division Bench decision he may seek his remedy within the parameter of the said decision or else he will have to reconcile to his fate.
This writ application is disposed of with the above observation.
RPS                              (Ajay Kumar Tripathi,J.)
