                              JUDGMENT
Radhakrishnan, J.
We find no error in the view expressed by the learned Single Judge. All the same, the appellant puts up a claim on the basis of the Dental Council of India, B.D.S. Course Regulations, 1996. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant states that as per the said Regulations a candidate for admission to the Dental Course must have obtained not less than 55% of the total marks in Science subjects (Physics, Chemistry & Biology) taken together (i) at the qualifying (or at a higher examination) in the case of dental colleges where the admissions are made on the basis of marks obtained at these examinations or (ii) 55% of the total marks in Science subjects (Physics, Chemistry & Biology) taken together at the competitive entrance examination where such examinations are held for selection. According to the learned counsel, in so far as the appellant is concerned, he has satisfied the first condition and the second is only an alternative. However, it is for the authorities to consider as to whether the distinction made by the Dental Council can be made applicable to persons like the appellant who claims to be an outstanding sportsman. The appellant has also made Annexure A representation before the first respondent. The first W.A.No.2094/2007 respondent shall take note of the same and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law, within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
Writ appeal is disposed of as above.
