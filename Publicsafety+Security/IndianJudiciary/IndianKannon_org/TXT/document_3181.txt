Need To Upgrade And Modernize Bagdogra Airport, West Bengal. on 15 March, 2007
an> Title: Need to upgrade and modernize Bagdogra Airport, West Bengal.
  SHRIMATI MINATI SEN (JALPAIGURI): I draw the attention of the Government to the long outstanding demand of upgradation of Bagdogra Airport to International standard. This important issue had been raised on this floor several times and also wrote to your office. But Government is yet to meet the demand. It may please be noted that Bagdogra is adjacent to Siliguri town, which has connectivity with the entire North East. In order to explore the rich potentialities of tourism industry of Darjeeling and Tarai areas up to an optimum level, upgradation of Bagdogra Airport is a must for air connectivity with different overseas airports and other domestic airports like Chennai, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The Government of India has already decided to connect Delhi and Thailand via Mynamar by road. The Nathula Pass is being opened for direct road connection with China. Naturally, the industrial potentiality of entire North Bengal will be increased manifold. Considering all these aspects, the Hon'ble Chief Minister of West Bengal wrote to Hon'ble Minister of Civil Aviation to upgrade the Bagdogra airport to International standard. I hope that, Government of India will take due care of the demand raised by Government of West Bengal and immediate actions will be taken to mitigate the problem of people of West Bengal.
