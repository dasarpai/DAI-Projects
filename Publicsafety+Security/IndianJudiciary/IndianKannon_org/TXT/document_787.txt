                   W.P.(C)No.13905          of 2010
                      ---------------------------------
          DATED THIS THE 27th DAY OF JULY, 2010

                              JUDGMENT
The petitioners are seeking for a direction to the respondents to consider Exhibits P17 to P24 appeals and stay petitions submitted by the petitioners and drop all proceedings against the petitioners by holding that they are entitled to continue with the poultry farm on the basis of deemed licence.
2. The learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent - Panchayat submitted that subsequent to the filing of the Writ Petition, a Sub Committee of the Panchayat was constituted to consider various aspects and on their recommendations, licences have been issued to petitioners 1, 3 and 4 for conducting a poultry farm. It is submitted that the 2nd petitioner has not so far filed an application and therefore no orders have been passed in his favour.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the 2nd petitioner has also filed an application. The same will be verified by the Panchayat and if the 2nd petitioner files a fresh application also, the same will be considered duly in terms of the rules and appropriate orders will be passed within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the application.
The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of recording the submission made by the learned counsel for the Panchayat that the petitioners 1, 3 and 4 have already been granted licence. No costs.
T.R.RAMACHANDRAN NAIR, JUDGE.
