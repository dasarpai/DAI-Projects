                                                  -----------
04 18-11-2010 The present petition was filed for restoration of Cr.Misc.No.26217 of 1998, which stood dismissed due to non- compliance of the per-emptory order dated 3.12.1998. It appears from the record that on 10.1.2000, the petitioner was directed to file a supplementary affidavit along with the order passed in M.J.C. No.3032 of 1998. Despite the judicial order, no supplementary affidavit was filed. Again on 10.9.2001, it was directed to list the case after filing of supplementary affidavit.
Office note shows that till date no supplementary affidavit has been filed. It appears that the petitioner is not at all interested in the present case and, as such, when the case was called out, none appeared on behalf of the petitioners.
Accordingly, the petition stands rejected.
