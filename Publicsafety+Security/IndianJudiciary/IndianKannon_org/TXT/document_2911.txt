C.N.Ramachandran Nair, J.
The Ordinance under challenge is superceded by statute under which a Tribunal is constituted to redress the grievance of parties. In view of the subsequent development, we close this W.P. as infructuous leaving freedom to the petitioners to approach the Tribunal constituted under the new Act or challenge the statute, if petitioners have continued grievance.
