                                                     ......
        Coram: Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.K.Merathia
                                                    ......
        For the Petitioner                    : Mr. A.K.Sahani, Advocate
        For the Respondents                   : JC to GA

Mr.   Sahani,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   petitioner  submitted that Chas Municipality is going to construct market on the PWD  Road. He further submitted that though the encroachments were removed  for   free   flow   of   traffic   but   then   the   Chas   Municipality   is   intending   to  construct market on the PWD Road for which permission was sought from  the   Executive   Engineer,   Road   Division,   PWD,   Chas,   Bokaro   but   the   said  permission was refused by memo no. 1139 dated 22/11/2010, (Annexure­7,  7/1), but in spite thereof Chas Municipality is going to construct the market  on the road. He further submitted that the Municipality cannot construct  market in front of the house of the petitioner also. He further submitted  that   the   representation   was   made   to   the   Deputy   Commissioner,   but   the  petitioner has not received any order passed by him.
Mr.   Sarvender   Kumar,   learned   counsel   for   the   State   submits  that in absence of the instructions/counter affidavit, he is not in a position  to accept or controvert the statements made in the writ petition.  
In the circumstances, I am inclined to remit the matter back to  the Deputy Commissioner, Bokaro, and, therefore, this writ petition is being  disposed of in absence of Chas Municipality.
The   petitioner   is   permitted   to   make   a   fresh   representation  before the Deputy Commissioner, Bokaro (Respondent No. 2), who will pass  a   reasoned   order   on   the   same   after   giving   opportunity   of   hearing   to   the  petitioner as well as Chas Municipality and PWD Road Division, Bokaro, in  accordance with law as early as possible and preferably within four weeks  from the date of receipt of such representation.
It is made clear that this Court has not gone into the merits of  the cases of the respective parties.  
With   these   observations   and   directions,   this   writ   petition  stands disposed of.
                           (R.K.Merathia, J) Mukund/­
