                               JUDGMENT
The petitioner applied and obtained a building permit for the construction of a residential building as evidenced by Ext.P1. She proposed to let access to her property by cutting open a new road through 30 cents of land lying on the northern side of the land where she is putting up a building. She was served by Ext.P3 stop memo issued by the second respondent alleging that she is filling paddy lands. She sought for getting the same vacated as per Ext.P4. The petitioner is aggrieved by the delay in further steps being taken by the first respondent.
2. I heard the learned Government Pleader also.
3. Ext.P5 shows that the first respondent has conducted a hearing on 23.6.2009. He shall pass final orders in the matter of Ext.P3 stop memo, after considering the petitioner's objection and the issue referred to therein within one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. The petitioner shall produce a copy of the Writ Petition along with the copy of the judgment before the first respondent for compliance.
The Writ Petition is disposed of as above.
