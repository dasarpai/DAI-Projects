                    ==================

                     W.P.(C).No.24791 of 2008

                    ==================

           Dated this the 4th day of September, 2008

                          J U D G M E N T
The petitioner challenges the order of the District Collector rejecting the application of the petitioner for NOC for obtaining a licence under the Explosives Act, by Ext.P4 order. Since the petitioner has a right of appeal before the Commissioner of Land Revenue as provided under Rule 168(4) of the Explosives Rules against Ext.P4, I am not inclined to entertain this writ petition at this stage. Therefore, without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to file an appeal against Ext.P4 before the Commissioner of Land Revenue, this writ petition is dismissed.
