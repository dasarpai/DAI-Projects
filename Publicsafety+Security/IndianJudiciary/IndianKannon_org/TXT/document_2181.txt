The evidence on record as discussed abo\ieiV__is not in dispute, the cheque impugned is under the 's.ig:nature of the accused. The trial Judge compared the it ___signature on the cheque with the admitted signature of the accused. On such comparison, it opined that the to show that there was no existing debt or liabiiity as on the date of presentation, there is no reason why the presumption under Section 139 of N.I.Act shouid no't»,have been drawn. The trial Court instead of the evidence in the Eight of this provision has. to borrowed by the husband of res,pon:d,en;t"'a,nd_,as it ' discharged by his disbeiéeved_evidéen_ce of theft co:rnp|a;in'ant:;n' Since the trial Court has effect of presumption under Act, the right course wouid be to the trial Court to of being heard and Zﬁgthenixgiftfo*1-._,ip'as'S<h:'apgropriate orders taking into considferationvft'i1e""ey;.d:e'nc'e:aiready on record.
