(3) (a) If, on receipt of an application referred to in sub- section (2), the former employer refuses to reinstate the applicant on the ground that his circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable for him to do so, or denies his liability to reinstate such former employee, or represents that the reinstatement by him of the former employee is impracticable, he shall, before the expiry of a period of fifteen days from the date of receipt of such application, make an application to the National Service (Hardship) Committee for relieving him from the obligation referred to in sub- section (2).
(b) A former employee, who is not reinstated in his former employment within fifteen days from the date of delivery of the application made under sub- section (2), may, within a further period of fifteen days (computed from the date on which the first- mentioned period of fifteen days expires), represent to the National Service (Hardship) Committee that his former employer has not discharged the obligation imposed on him by sub- section (2).
(c) On receipt of the application referred to in clause (a) or the representation referred to in clause (b), the National Service (Hardship) Committee shall, after considering all matters placed before it and after making such inquiry in the matter as it may think fit, make an order-
