Permission to file SLP is granted in SLP(C)Nos......CC 12369/2010 & 12370/2010.

       senior     counsel appearing on behalf of the Board of
       Governors, Medical Council of India,              submits
that though the students' initial admission is irregular and illegal but in deference to the Court's intervention, they have decided to permit 150 students to appear in the examinations which are scheduled to commence from 23rd August, 2010. Mr. Sharan further submits that in lieu of permitting these 150 students, the Petitioner Institution would be required to surrender 150 seats from the Management quota in the next five academic years.
                   Mr.      K.K.        Venugopal,        learned
       senior           counsel       appearing on behalf of the
Institution submits that 63 seats from the management quota have already been taken by the respondents. He further submits that the admissions of 150 students were neither illegal nor irregular.
At this juncture, we are not adjudicating on the rival contentions of the parties because the main writ petition is still pending in the High Court. We direct the Medical Council of India to file a proper affidavit before the High Court of M.P. at Jabalpur, within three weeks from today with an advance copy thereof to the other side, who would be at liberty to file rejoinder thereto, if any, within two weeks thereafter. This controversy would also be decided along with the writ petition. In the facts and circumstances of this case, we request the High Court to dispose of the main writ petition as expeditiously as possible, in any event, within two months from the date of communication of this order. The High Court would be entitled to decide the writ petition without being influenced by any observation made in this order. These special leave petitions are accordingly disposed of.
As the interest of the petitioners who are the students of respondent College namely People's College of Medical Sciences
