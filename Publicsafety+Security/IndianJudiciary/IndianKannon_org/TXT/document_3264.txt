        R.P.No.92 of 2010 in W.P.(C) No.542 of 2009
                     -------------------------------

            Dated this the 24th day of February, 2010

                              O R D E R
Raman, Ag.C.J.
We have disposed of the writ petition permitting the petitioner to undertake the repairs in the Sastha Temple situated outside the main Devi temple as an offering and also to conduct poojas without conferring any right as such on him. It is now pointed out that the petitioner may not always be available and some times other family members also have to conduct the poojas in the Sastha temple. In such circumstances, it is prayed that such permission may be extended to other eligible members of his family and the Santhi of the main Devi Temple.
Accordingly, the review petition is disposed of clarifying that all that now intended is to enable the petitioner or anybody on his behalf to conduct the poojas. As such, there is RP.No.92 of 2010 no scope for taking the view that the 'petitioner' alone is permitted and it includes anybody on his behalf.
P.R.RAMAN, Ag. CHIEF JUSTICE P.R.RAMACHANDRA MENON, JUDGE nj.
