ORAL ORDER
Learned Public Prosecutor Mr.Arun D. Oza, appearing for the State, sought time in order to place on record the facts about which instructions are being received and accordingly file an affidavit of the investigating officer concerned. Learned counsel Mr.Agrawal submitted that, according to his instructions, the building in which the offences alleged against the petitioner were alleged to have been committed is presently in the exclusive possession of the landlord and the statement of the learned Public Prosecutor that the same building was being used for the same purpose was not correct. He, however, stated that the petitioner was not in a position to make an affidavit to state such facts on oath. It would, however, be advisable for the learned Public Prosecutor to give a copy of the affidavit proposed to be filed in advance to Mr.Agrawal so as to facilitate his reply thereto. S.O. to 04th December, 2002 at 03.30 p.m. as suggested by the learned counsel.
