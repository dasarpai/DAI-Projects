Hon'ble V.K. Shukla,J.
Present writ petition as against petitioner No.2 is dismissed with liberty to file fresh writ petition.
As far as petitioner No. 1 is concerned his grievance is that under the provisions of Indian Arms Act for grant of firearm licence, he had moved application on 05.12.2009 before the licensing authority, but till date no final decision has been taken on the same.
As inaction is being complained on the part of the licensing authority, as such licensing authority is directed to see and ensure that the application of the petitioner is disposed of in accordance with law, expeditiously, preferably, within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
In terms of above observation and direction, present writ petition stands disposed of.
