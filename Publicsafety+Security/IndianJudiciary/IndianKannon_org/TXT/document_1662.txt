His presence is no longer required and he e ad has been discharged.
Both the applications arise from the same crime number, Pr they are being disposed of by a common order. These are the second applications for grant of bail under Section a hy 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 moved by the applicants. The first one having been dismissed as withdrawn ad vide order dated 29/01/2018 passed in M.Cr.C.Nos.20706/2017 M and 21852/2017, who have been arrested in connection with of Crime No.14/2017 for offences punishable under Sections 420, 468, 471, 120-B of I.P.C and 25 and 27 of Arms Act registered at rt Police Station-S.T.F Bhopal (M.P) ou The applicants have been arrested on the basis of 27 memorandum of Donald David Jackub and Manish Advin from C whom the offending fire arms were seized, from the h ig applicant Sheikh Sajid, three pistols and fourteen cartridges have been seized and from the applicant Jagdish Yadav, two H pistols and ten cartridges have been seized. They are in judicial custody since 12/10/2017 and 07/10/2017. The allegation against them is that they have been the purchasers of the fire arms being sold by the principal accused Donald David Jackub and Manish Advin. Against the applicant Sheikh Sajid, there are seven cases pending against him including the present case, out of which, there are three other cases under the Arms act. As regards the applicant Jagdish Yadav is concerned, there is only one another case of the year 2016 under Section 325 of the I.P.C besides the present case. Looking at the period of incarceration already undergone by the applicants herein and the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed, I am inclined to allow M.Cr.C Nos.4629/2018 & 4633/2018 for grant of bail and direct that the applicants herein be enlarged on bail upon their furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) each with one solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
