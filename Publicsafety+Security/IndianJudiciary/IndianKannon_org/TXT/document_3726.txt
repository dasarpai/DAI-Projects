      Dated this the 30th day of September, 2008

                      JUDGMENT
Petitioners are prosecuting their B.Sc Nursing Course and are due to appear for the final year examination. Dissatisfied by the marks obtained by them in the third year supplementary examination for one paper in the case of petitioners 1, 2 and 3 and two papers in the case of the fourth petitioner, they sought for a revaluation as evidenced by Ext.P1 series. They have approached this Court for a direction to the respondents to publish the results of the revaluation and also to permit them to appear for the fourth year final year examination.
2. Learned Standing Counsel for the University Mr.M.Sasindran submits that the result of the revaluation will be published at the earliest, at any rate, within one month from today. Submission is recorded. In so far as the prayer for permitting the petitioners to participate in the final year examination W.P.(C).28315/2008 pending publication of the results of the revaluation, I am afraid that this position has been dealt with by the Division Bench in Writ Appeal Nos.1393/2008 and 1342/2008 which has been followed by a learned Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No.15024/2008. This Court has framed upon the practice of permission being granted to the final year student to participate in the examination, eligibility to which cannot be acquired by the candidates except by a pass in the examination for the previous year or semester as the case may be.
3. In the circumstances, writ petition is disposed of directing the respondents to publish the results of the revaluation as sought for by the petitioners, at the earliest at any rate, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
V.GIRI, Judge mrcs
