                    O.P. No.17858 of 2000
                    ------------------------------
            Dated this the 17th day of June, 2009

                        J U D G M E N T
----------------------
1. The petitioner is approaching this Court against the refusal to permit alteration of the class of his vehicle, Bus bearing Reg:No:KL10/K-351, as an "Educational Institution Bus". Petitioner is the Manager of the school for the use of which the Bus is purchased. The Bus is purchased in the name of the petitioner in his capacity as Manager of the School. The objection in allowing the requested alteration is that the ownership of the vehicle is not in the name of the institution.
2. With respect to another vehicle owned by the petitioner, this Court by Judgment in OP.No.16879/01 dated 23.9.2002 had issued directions to the registering authority to register the vehicle as an "Educational Institution Bus", with the Manager of the school as its registered owner. Following the above judgment I feel that identical relief can be granted in this case also.
In the result, the writ petition is allowed directing the 2nd respondent to register the Bus bearing Registration No:KL10/K-351 as an "Educational Institution Bus" with the petitioner as its registered owner. Needless to say that the authorities are at liberty to make verification regarding usage of the Bus and if it is found that the Bus is being used for any purpose other than transporting school children, then they are free to take action for such misuse.
C.K.ABDUL REHIM, JUDGE.
