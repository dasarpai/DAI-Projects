Regarding petitioner No.6, who has been promoted as Deputy General Manager, it has been stated that his case has been referred to the Government and as and when the approval will be granted, he will also be given the pay scale of the promotional post.
In view of the aforesaid letter, this petition has become infructuous and the same is dismissed as such.
However, it will be open for petitioner No.6 to approach the Court, if necessary relief is not granted to him in due course of time.
