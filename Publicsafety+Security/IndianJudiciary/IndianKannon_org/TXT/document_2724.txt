RANJIT SINGH, J.
Mr.Rathee points out that family pension, which was earlier withdrawn, has now been sanctioned to the petitioner as this issue has fairly been settled by this Court now.
The writ petition is accordingly rendered infructuous and is disposed of as such. The respondents shall send a copy of the order restoring the family pension to the petitioner.
