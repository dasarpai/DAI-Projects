                 Dated this the 24th February, 2010.

                                    JUDGMENT
The petitioner is a stage carriage operator conducting services on the route Vadagara-Thalassery-Kozhikode with stage carriage vehicle No: KL-18/C 7999. Her timings were issued on 27.9.1999. According to the petitioner since the settlement of her timings the KSRTC has introduced a service on the route causing clash with her timings. The timings of local trains to and from Kozhikode also cause inconvenience to the operation of petitioner's service with the settled timings. Therefore, the petitioner has submitted a request for the revision of her own timings. Her complaint is that no orders have been passed thereon. The Govt. Pleader submits that her request would be considered and appropriate orders passed without further delay.
2. In the above circumstances this writ petition is disposed of directing the respondent to consider the request of the petitioner for variation of her timings evidenced by Ext.P1, in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible and at any rate within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
