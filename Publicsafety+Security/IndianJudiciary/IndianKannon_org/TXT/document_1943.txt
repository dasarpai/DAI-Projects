                    Kaushal Kishore Singh son of Late Sri Ram Sharma
                                         Versus
                                   The State Of Bihar
                                        -----------
5/ 25.07.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The petitioner was refused bail by order dated 23.03.2010 vide Cr. Misc. No.8126 of 2010 since there was allegation against him of having threw the informant on account of which he lost his leg and later on life.
I am not inclined to review the earlier order. Prayer for bail is once again rejected.
The Trial Court is directed to send a list of the witnesses fixing specific dates for their examination along with a copy of this order to the Superintendent of Police, Vaishali, who is directed to ensure the attendance of the witnesses on the date fixed so that there is no further delay in the trial.
