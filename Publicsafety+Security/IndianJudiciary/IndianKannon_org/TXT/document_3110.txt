ORAL
ORDER
(Per : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.L.DAVE) This is an application for condonation of delay of 110 days caused in filing the Letters Patent Appeal.
2. Learned advocate Mr.D.R.Bhatt appearing for the opponent has relied on the decision of the Apex Court rendered in the case of P.K.Ramachandran v. State of Kerala & Anr. AIR 1998 SC 2276.
3. Having gone through the judgment, we are of the view that in light of the supporting affidavit filed by the applicant side, it cannot be said that the cause of delay is not reasonably explained. The judgment, therefore, cannot be of any help to the opponent. The delay caused in filing the appeal, therefore, deserves to be condoned. Accordingly, this application is allowed. Delay is condoned. Rule is made absolute. No costs.
