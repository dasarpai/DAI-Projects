Patna High Court - Orders
Ram Prasad Safi vs The State Of Bihar & Ors. on 5 July, 2011
                   IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                             MJC No.3140 of 2009
                               Ram Prasad Safi
                                    Versus
                          The State Of Bihar & Ors.
                                 -----------
02. 05.07.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the State.
A show cause has been filed on behalf of the Opposite Party No. 2 stating therein that the order has been complied with and decision has already been taken in respect of the grievance of the petitioner as per the office order as contained in Memo No. 221 dated 4th of February 2005.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the aforesaid order was not communicated to the petitioner. Beside the above, the aforesaid order is not correct in law.
Be that as it may, since the decision has already been taken in this matter, this contempt application need not proceed further and the same stands disposed of.
