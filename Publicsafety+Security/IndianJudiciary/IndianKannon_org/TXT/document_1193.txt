Information Commissioner : Shri Satyananda Mishra Decision Notice Appeal allowed Elements of the decision:
CPIO is directed to provide information.   CIC/SM/A/2010/000891
2. The   Appellant   was   present   in   the   Siwan   studio   of   the   NIC.   The  Respondent was present in the Mumbai studio. We heard their submissions.
3. The Appellant had wanted to know some details about the termination of  a certain scheme in which he had invested in 1994. Although the CPIO had  provided the detail information in this regard, during the hearing, the Appellant  submitted that all that he wanted to know was how the money invested by him  in 1994 grew over the years till the UTI decided to discontinue the scheme. We  think he has a right to get this information. Therefore, we direct the CPIO to  provide to the Appellant within 10 working days from the receipt of this order a  detailed statement of account showing the growth of his investment from the  beginning till the date of termination of the scheme.
4. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
5. Copies of this order be given free of cost to the parties.
