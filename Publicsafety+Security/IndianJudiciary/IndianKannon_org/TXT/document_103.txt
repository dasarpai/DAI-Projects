> Title: Need to allow students of Centre for Excellence courses in IITs for applying to jobs in PSUs.
SHRIMATI BOTCHA JHANSI LAKSHMI (VIZIANAGARAM): Thank you, Madam Chairman, for giving me an opportunity to raise a matter of urgent public importance.
          As you know, the Centre of Excellence courses were started during 2005-06 onwards in various ITIs in different sectors across the country.  In this connection, in Andhra Pradesh,  they were started under different schemes like domestic, World Bank, PPP mode with Rs. 3.5 crore of grants for each ITI.  In my State, about 29 Government ITIs were upgraded with the World Bank assistance as Centre of Excellence (CoE).
          The course curriculum had been designed by the Director-General of Employment and Training, New Delhi and recognized by the NCVT with multi-skill orientation, which is the present requirement of the Indian industry; and the courses were very advanced when compared to the regular ITI general trades with a vision of producing world-class work force.
          In this connection , in spite of this, the trainees trained in the CoE were not allowed to apply in the public sector industries and the Central Government organizations like the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, Naval Dock Yard, RRB, Defence, and Railways in their recruitments. Though the trainees were well trained on the modern machinery along with plant training who have acquired advanced skills, they are being denied opportunities in the above-mentioned organizations. They are not recognizing the courses approved by the NCVT.
          In view of this, I would request, through you, Madam Chairman, the hon. Minister to take suitable steps to consider the Centre of Excellence trainees in the recruitment to the public sector industries and other Central Government organizations at par with the general ITI trades; otherwise the students trained in the Centre of Excellence under trades would be rendered jobless.
          I would also request the Ministry to ensure that specified skills at industry for six months may also be considered as apprenticeship and allow them to appear for apprenticeship trade tests in the concerned industry.
MADAM CHAIRMAN : Now, the House stands adjourned to meet again tomorrow, that is, 16th March, 2010 at 11 a.m.   18.31 hrs The Lok Sabha then adjourned till Eleven of the Clock on Tuesday, March 16, 2010/Phalguna 25, 1931 (Saka).
