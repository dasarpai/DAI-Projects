                  W.P.(C).13989 of 2009
             ---------------------------
          Dated this the 22nd day of May, 2009

                       JUDGMENT
Petitioners are the Final Semester B.Tech (Computer Science) students of Government Engineering College, Trichur. The College is affiliated to the Calicut University. They submit that they failed in certain papers. Apparently, dissatisfied with the marks obtained by them, they had applied for revaluation of the papers for which they failed. They are aggrieved that the results of the revaluation has not been published so far.
2. I heard learned standing counsel for the University also. There is no justification for the delay in the publication of results of revaluation.
Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of directing the 2nd respondent to publish the results of the revaluation sought for by the petitioners, as early as possible, at any rate, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment, provided W.P.(C).13989 of 2009 :: 2 ::
the applications for revaluation are in order and otherwise correct.
