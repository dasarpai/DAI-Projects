Exts. P1, P2 and P3 are the applications stated to have been made by the petitioner for revaluation of different papers of his B.Tech course in Electronics and Communication Engineering. The complaint is that there has not been any action on these applications of the petitioner.
2. I heard the standing counsel for the University also.
Having regard to the facts of this case, I dispose of this writ petition directing that the University shall take further action on Exts. P1 to P3 and complete the revaluation applied for by the petitioner, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within six weeks, provided the applications made by the petitioner are proper and valid.
