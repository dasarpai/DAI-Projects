IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH.
                      ***
.
CWP No. 20471 of 2006.
Date of decision: August 26, 2008.
*** Mool Chand Tyagi Versus State of Haryana and others.
*** CORAM: Hon'ble Mr. Justice T.S.Thakur, CJ and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Surya Kant.
*** Present: Shri Hemant Saini, Advocate, for the petitioner.
Shri Rameshwar Malik, Additional AG, Haryana, for respondents No. 1 and 2.
Shri Jasbir Mor, Advocate, for respondents No. 3 and 4.
*** T.S.Thakur, Chief Justice (Oral) Special Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban Local Bodies Department and the Commissioner, Faridabad Municipal Corporation, both are present in person. They submit that 20 sets of draft Bye-laws received by the Government from Municipal Corporation, Faridabad have already been notified by the Government in terms of different gazette notifications dated August 22, 2008. They further state that given three months time, the Government shall notify the Bye-laws in terms of Section 394 of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994.
In the circumstances and keeping in view the fact that the entire process is now nearing completion and all that is to be done is to receive the objections and consider the objections, we see no reason why the writ petition should remain pending on the Board of this Court. We, accordingly, dispose of the writ petition with a direction that the Government, shall within a given period of three months from to-day, finalize the draft Bye-laws and finally publish the same in terms of Section
-2- CWP No. 20471 of 2006.
394 of the Act afore-mentioned. The parties are left to bear their own costs.
