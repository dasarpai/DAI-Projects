The petitioner is working as a principal of a Government Higher Secondary School. The petitioner is aggrieved by Exts.P5 and P6 orders transferring and posting principals in existing vacancies without considering the options exercised by senior persons. In the above circumstances, the petitioner has filed Ext.P7 petition before the 1st respondent. The petitioner seeks a direction to the 1st respondent to consider and pass orders on Ext.P7 expeditiously.
2. I have heard the learned Government Pleader also.
3. In the facts and circumstances of the case, I dispose of this writ petition with a direction to the 1st respondent to consider and pass orders on Ext.P7, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, before the next general transfers.
