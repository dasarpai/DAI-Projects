                                SHYAM DEO PANDEY
                                        Versus
                            THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS
                                      -----------
4 27/08/2010 It is a clear case of apathy on the part of the respondents which has generated yet another litigation. Petitioner who is stated to be a daily wager is an applicant on the basis of advertisement dated 27.06.2002 as contained in annexure-1. This advertisement was for making regular appointment in the district but his grievance is that till date no exercise has been carried out in furtherance to the said advertisement.
Since no counter affidavit has been filed, the Court is not wiser on this issue. Five years is a long time for this writ to be pending for adjudication on this simple issue.
Let an affidavit be filed on behalf of the State within two weeks.
Matter will come up in top ten cases after two weeks.
If the affidavit is not filed by the next date, the District Magistrate, Lakhisarai will pay a sum of Rs.2000/- (Two thousand) from his own pocket to the petitioner as cost.
AMIN/                   (Ajay Kumar Tripathi, J.)
