02/ 22.12.2010 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State.
Petitioner is an accused for offences punishable under section 136 of the Electricity Act.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the case is with respect to theft of aluminum wire of eight electric poles. He also avers that neither petitioner was arrested at the spot nor any incriminating material has been recovered from his possession nor he was even named in the F.I.R. He further states that petitioner was implicated only on the basis of confessional statement of one co-accused person which was absolutely false and unreliable. He also contends that petitioner has got no criminal antecedents and he is in custody since 01.09.2010.
Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, this petition for bail is allowed. Let petitioner Mohan Paswan be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000(Rupees ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of A.C.J.M. Hilsa, District-Nalanda in connection with Tharthari P.S.Case No.15 of 2010.
