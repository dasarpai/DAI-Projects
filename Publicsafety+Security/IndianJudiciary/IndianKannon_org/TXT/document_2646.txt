Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. WRIT PETITION No. - 20621 of 2007

Petitioner :- Smt. Guddi & Others
Respondent :- State Of U.P. & Others
Petitioner Counsel :- D.K. Srivastava,Yogesh Kumar
Respondent Counsel :- Govt. Advocate

Hon'ble R.K. Agrawal,J.
Hon'ble S.C. Agarwal,J.
It has been stated by the learned Additional Government Advocate that charge sheet in this matter has been filed against all the accused. Filing of charge sheet would mean that the allegations in the First Information Report have been prima facie corroborated by evidence collected during investigation. In such a situation, it would not be appropriate to enter into questions of fact and to quash the First Information Report. Consequently, we dismiss this writ petition without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.
The interim order is vacated.
