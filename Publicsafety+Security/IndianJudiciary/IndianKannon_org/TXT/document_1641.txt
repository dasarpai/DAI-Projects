Hon'ble Dilip Gupta,J.
The Committee of Management dispute is in issue in the present petition which was filed in the year 2000. The term of the Committee of Management came to an end long back and several elections may have taken place in between. The petition has, therefore, been rendered infructuous by lapse of time. It is, accordingly, dismissed.
It is, however, made clear that dismissal of this petition will not affect the validity of the subsequent election(s).
Order Date :- 19.1.2010 NSC
