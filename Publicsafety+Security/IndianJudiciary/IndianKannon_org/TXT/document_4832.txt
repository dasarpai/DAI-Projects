ORAL
ORDER
By way of present application, the applicant-State of Gujarat has inter alia prayed to cancel the order of granting regular bail to the respondents-accused vide order dated 15th April 2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.18, Ahmedabad City in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.1266 of 2010.
Heard Mr.H.L. Jani, learned Additional Public Prosecutor and Mr.Faiyazi Shaikh, learned counsel for the respondents-accused.
Mr.Faiyazi Shaikh produced on record order dated 01st November 2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.16, Ahmedabad whereby the condition No.6 i.e. "applicants are directed to mark their presence before the concerned Police Station till the trial is over" imposed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.18, Ahmedabad is deleted and exempted the respondent No.1-Mohammed Hanif @ Annubhai Abdulbhai Sheikh from marking his presence on every 5th day of the calendar month.
In view of order dated 01st November 2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.16, Ahmedabad produced on record by Mr.Shaikh, Mr.Jani, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, does not press the present application qua the respondent No.1- Mohammed Hanif @ Annubhai Abdulbhai Sheikh.
In view of above, present application is disposed of as not pressed qua respondent No.1- Mohmmed Hanif @ Annubhai Abdulbhai Sheikh. Rule is discharged qua respondent No.1.
Mr.Jani, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, has contended that the the respondent No.2 was released on regular bail by the learned trial Judge on several conditions, one of which is "applicants are directed to mark their presence before the concerned Police Station till the trial is over". He has further contended that despite the condition imposed upon him, the present respondent No.2 has never bothered to mark his presence before the concerned Police Station till today. Mr.Jani has also contended that the respondent No.2 is involved in a serious offence punishable under Sections 307, 143, 147, 149, 323, 324, 294(B) of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 135(1) of the Bombay Police Act. Mr.Jani has contended that to maintain law and order situation and to secure his presence at the time of trial, the said condition is imposed upon the respondent No.2, but respondent No.2 has never bothered to follow the condition imposed upon him. He, therefore, contended that the order dated 15th April 2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.18, Ahmedabad City in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.1266 of 2010 is required to be cancelled qua the respondent No.2.
Mr.
Faiyazi Shaikh, learned counsel for the respondents-accused, has contended that it is true that respondent No.2 has never appeared before the concerned Police Station as per the condition imposed upon him. He has also contended that at the same time it is also true that the respondent No.2 is not involved in any other offence till date. Mr.Shaikh has also contended that the respondent No.2 is regularly appearing before the trial Court. He, therefore, contended that some lenient view is required to be taken and the present application is required to be dismissed.
I have gone through the papers produced before me as well as submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties. I have also gone through the order passed by the learned trial Judge.
Looking to the papers, it appears that while enlarging the respondent No.2-accused on bail, certain conditions were imposed upon him by the learned trial Judge and the respondent No.2-accused has never bothered to follow the same.
It also appears from the order dated 01st November 2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.16, Ahmedabad passed in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.3689 of 2010, application filed by the respondent No.2 for exemption from marking presence is rejected. Looking to the submissions advanced by the learned counsel, it appears that the respondent No.2 has never marked his presence before the concerned Police Station. It also appears from the papers that the respondent No.2 is involved in a serious offence punishable under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and he is a head strong person. Hence, I pass following order:
"order dated 15th April 2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.18, Ahmedabad City in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.1266 of 2010 is hereby cancelled and set aside qua respondent No.2-Mohmmed Imran Mohmmed Hanif Sheikh. Respondent No.2 is hereby directed to surrender himself immediately before the Police Authority."
In view of above observations, present application is partly allowed. Rule is made absolute qua respondent No.2.
