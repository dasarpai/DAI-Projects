                                JUDGMENT
Koshy,J.
The appellant is an aspirant for the post of Part-time Sweeper in Kadakkal Fire and Rescue Services. The appellant was also called for interview along with the others, but, she was not selected and the third respondent was selected. Ext.P4 letter shows that first respondent himself conducted the interview on 22.09.2007 and out of the eight persons appeared for interview, he selected the third respondent whom he found suitable. Contention of the appellant is that she was the senior most applicant. She is nearing the age of 50. It is further stated that she passed SSLC, whereas the third respondent did not pass SSLC. However, the applications produced would show that there are applicants with Pre-degree and with KGTE Type writing etc. The post is only for a part-time sweeper. SSLC is not a required qualification for that post. Good physique is the only required qualification. All the applicants are from below poverty line. One of the persons was found suitable and selected. No specific averments of malafides on the part of the respondents are mentioned. The allegations of political interference etc. cannot be looked into without producing any evidence for substantiating the same. Considering the merits of the case, we are of the opinion that this is not a case where interference should be made by this court.
The appeal is dismissed.
