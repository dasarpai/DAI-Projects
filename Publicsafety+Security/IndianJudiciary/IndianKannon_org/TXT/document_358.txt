This review petition is filed seeking to review the interim order passed by this Court dated 06.04.2009 in I.A.No.4726 of 2009. In the said interim order, a direction was issued to the 1st respondent to consider the claim of the petitioner for reassignment of the date of promotion as UDC with effect from 06.10.1991 in the light of Exhibit P9 Government Order. It is pointed out in the review petition that the Government has cancelled Exhibit P9 order as per Annexure-I order. Therefore, in the light of Annexure-I order, the interim order dated 06.04.2009 stands recalled.
This review petition is allowed.
