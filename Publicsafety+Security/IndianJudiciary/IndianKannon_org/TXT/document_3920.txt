COCP No.1423 of 2009 In this case, the petitioner has alleged disobedience of the interim order dated 08.04.2008 passed by this Court in CWP No.5789 of 2008. It is not in dispute that the main writ petition itself was dismissed as having become infructuous on 07.03.2009.
Thus, I find no merit in this petition. Dismissed.
