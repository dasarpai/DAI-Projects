As early as on 17.8.07 there was a direction to take steps to issue fresh notice. It was also made clear "If no steps are taken the appeal will stand dismissed for non- prosecution." Three years have elapsed. A little finger is not moved. So the order passed by the learned Judge on 17.8.07 has to be made absolute. Therefore the Appeal is dismissed for default.
