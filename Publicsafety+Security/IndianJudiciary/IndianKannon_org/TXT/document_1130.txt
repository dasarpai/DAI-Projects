              IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                        Cr.Misc. No.26395 of 2010
             SUDHIR MANDAL, S/o Late Hukum Chandra Mandal.
                                  Versus
                           THE STATE OF BIHAR
                                 -----------
03. 30.03.2011 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the State.
The petitioner seeks bail in a case instituted for the offences under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
By order dated 20.11.2009 vide Cr.Misc. No. 24093 of 2009 the petitioner was refused bail and the prayer has been renewed on the ground that there is undue delay in trial. When a report was called for from the Trial Court about the reason for delay it transpired that the petitioner has filed a quashing application before this Court, due to this the application has been adjourned. Since the petitioner himself has contributed to the delay, I am not inclined to review the said order on this ground. The prayer for bail is once again rejected.
