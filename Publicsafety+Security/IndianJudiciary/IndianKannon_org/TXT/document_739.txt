Hon'ble Sudhir Agarwal,J.
1. Called in revise. None appeared on behalf of the petitioners to press this writ petition. Learned Standing Counsel is present for respondents.
2. It appears that either the cause of action no more survives or that petitioners have lost interest in this matter or it has otherwise become infructuous and, probably for this reason, none is interested to have decided this matter on merits and that is why, counsel for petitioners is absent.
3. Dismissed. Interim order, if any, stands vacated.
Order Date :- 17.10.2019 Manish Himwan
