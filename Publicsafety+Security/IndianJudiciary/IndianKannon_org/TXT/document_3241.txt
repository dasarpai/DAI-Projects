:O R D E R
Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner as well as for the respondents. With the consent of the counsels, the writ petition itself is taken up for final disposal.
2.The main grievance of the petitioner is that he had not been given an opportunity of hearing before the impugned order had been passed and therefore, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the order of the first respondent is to be quashed.
3.In view of the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and since the impugned order had been passed by the first respondent without giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, the order of the first respondent is quashed leaving it open to the respondents to pass appropriate orders, after giving a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned, within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
5.Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. Consequently, the connected M.P.(MD) is closed. No costs.
To The President, Arulmigu Poonga Murugan Thirukoil, Madurai and another 
