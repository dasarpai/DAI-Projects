                                       ORDER
Petitioner, who is the sole accused in C.C.No.678/2004 of J.F.C.M, Kasaragod for an offence punishable under Section 498A IPC and whose case is now numbered as L.P. No.132/2008 seeks a direction to the said Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail on the date of his surrender itself.
2. Admittedly, non-bailable warrants of arrest are pending against the petitioner. The circumstances under which those non-bailable warrants of arrest came to be issued against the petitioner are not discernible to this Court. It is only proper that the petitioner surrenders before the learned Magistrate and seeks regular bail.
Accordingly, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of permitting the petitioner to surrender before the learned Magistrate and file an application for regular bail within a period of two weeks from today. In case, the petitioner complies with the above condition, his bail application shall be considered and disposed of on merits preferably on the same date on which it is filed notwithstanding the pendency of any non-bailable warrants against him.
Dated this the 17th day of August, 2010 V. RAMKUMAR, (JUDGE) sj
