                                          JUDGMENT
Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan, J, We have looked into the pleadings. We do not deem it appropriate to make any particular statement touching the averments, since they are made in relation to allegations of certain acts attributable to certain individuals. However, on the totality of the circumstances, we deem it appropriate that Ext.P1 gains attention of a competent superior police officer. The fourth respondent is therefore directed to send up a report forthwith with a copy of Ext.P1 to respondent No.2, who may issue such direction as may be deemed necessary on the facts and circumstances of the case.
Writ Petition ordered accordingly.
Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan, Judge P. Bhavadasan, Judge sb.
