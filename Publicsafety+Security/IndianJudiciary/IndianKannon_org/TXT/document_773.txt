                  W.P.(C).No.4161 OF 2009
               ------------------------
            Dated this the 11th day of March, 2009.

                           JUDGMENT
The prayer in this writ petition is to direct the 2nd respondent to take necessary steps to conduct scrutiny of the answer sheets of the petitioner who attended for the 4th semester examination in Criminal Procedure Code-Paper II. The University has today placed before me the answer sheets in question, which shows that the petitioner himself has given an endorsement which reads as under.
"Verified my answer script of Cr.P.C with false No.13751 and submitted a complaint for removing the marks in inner pages."
From this it is evident that the scrutiny of the answer paper as sought for by the petitioner has already been allowed.
In view of this there is no question of allowing the prayer sought for in this writ petition.
Writ Petition fails and is dismissed.
