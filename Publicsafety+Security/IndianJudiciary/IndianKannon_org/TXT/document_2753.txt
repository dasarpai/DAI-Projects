In respect of a mortgage property taken by the company as security for a housing loan, in a suit filed by a third party as O.S No.217 of 2009 before the Sub Court, Ernakulam an attachment over that mortgage property had been passed is the case of the petitioner. An application was moved in the above suit by the petitioner for lifting the attachment or passing of appropriate orders declaring his first charge over the property. Though the application was filed three months before, it is yet to receive consideration from the court is the grievance espoused for issuing directions/orders to the court below for disposal W.P.(C).No.31595 OF 2009 Page numbers of that application expeditiously. Having regard to the submissions made and taking note of the facts and circumstances presented, I direct the learned Sub Judge Ernakulam to dispose of Ext.P3 application as expeditiously as possible at any rate before the closing of the courts for the mid summer vacation in 2010.
