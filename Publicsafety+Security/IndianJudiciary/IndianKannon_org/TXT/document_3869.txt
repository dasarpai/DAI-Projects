NAWAB SINGH, J. (ORAL)
Notice of motion.
Mr. Sudhir Nehra, Addl. Advocate General, Punjab accepts no- tice on behalf of respondents No.1 to 3-State.
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioners, who are major, have married against the wishes of their parents on July 25th, 2011 and they now apprehend danger to their lives at the hands of respon- dents No.4 & 5. Reliance in this regard has been placed on copies of Educa- tional Qualification Certificates, Photographs and Marriage Certificate (An- nexure P-1 to P-4 respectively). It has been also contended that the petition- ers have moved a representation (Annexure P-5) to the Senior Superinten- dent of Police, Tarn Taran, in this regard.
In this view of the matter, the Senior Superintendent of Police, Tarn Taran, is directed to look into representation (Annexure P-5) and if there is any substance in it, may proceed further, in accordance with law.
Disposed of.
