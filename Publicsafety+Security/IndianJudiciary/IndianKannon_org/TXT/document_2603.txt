However, keeping in mind the entirety of the allegations and the subsequent compromise, let the petitioner above named surrender in the Court below within a period of four weeks from today when he shall be enlarged on anticipatory bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 20,000/- (twenty thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Sri A. K. Singh, Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Bhojpur, Ara in connection with Udwant Nagar P.S. Case No. 230 of 2004, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr. P.C.
The observations herein with regard to the compromise are confined in their applicability for the purpose of bail only.
