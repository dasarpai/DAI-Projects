Present : Mr. Gurcharan Singh, Advocate
          for the petitioner.

MAHESH GROVER, J.
This revision petition is directed against the order dated 10.2.2005 by which the evidence of the petitioner was closed by order, and order dated 17.9.2008 by which the application of the petitioner for setting aside the order dated 10.2.2005 was dismissed.
The case has been pending since 1999. In this view of the matter the impugned order dated 10.2.2005 cannot be termed to be erroneous and the approach of the Court is justified. However, considering the fact that a plea has been raised that the evidence will be concluded on one date, in my opinion and purely in the interest of justice this revision can be disposed of without issuance of notice of motion as resorting to this process is likely to delay the proceedings further and also for the reason that equitable justice can be ensured by compensating the other side with costs.
Accordingly, the petition is accepted and the impugned orders are set aside subject to payment of Rs.2,000/- as costs which shall be deposited with the State Legal Services Authority, Punjab. The Labour Court is directed to afford one effective opportunity to the petitioner to conclude his evidence.
19.12.2008                                 (MAHESH GROVER)
