----------------------
Learned counsel for appellants reports no instructions. Appellants called, found absent.
On 11.2.2009 when this appeal came up for hearing it was represented by the learned counsel for appellants that appellants 3 and 4 are understood to be dead. Thereon, learned counsel was directed to file a statement in that regard within ten days. No such statement is filed. According to learned counsel, he has no instruction or information about the appellants.
Hence this appeal is dismissed for non-prosecution. No costs. Civil Miscellaneous Petition No.219 of 2000 shall stand dismissed.
THOMAS P.JOSEPH, JUDGE.
