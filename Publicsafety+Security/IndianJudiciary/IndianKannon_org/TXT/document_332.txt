                                          -----------
3. 21.07.2010 From the report at flag 'X' called in this fourth application for bail in a Police case under Section 302 of the Penal Code, the petitioner stated to be the main assailant, there is no occasion to reconsider the prayer for bail as the trial is on the verge of conclusion with only Investigating Officer and the doctor concerned remaining to be examined.
Place of posting of Police Officers has been furnished by the Police Department to this Court which in tern has been forwarded to all the District Judges. If the Police officer does not respond to the summons directions are issued to initiate summary proceeding against him under Section 350 Cr.P,C. and conclude the trial at the earliest.
In so far as the doctor witness is concerned the Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna shall ensure that the Investigating Officer not only appears himself but ensures the appearance of the former also. The failure of the Investigating Officer to make the doctor appear shall again render him vulnerable to proceeding under Section 350 Cr.P.C.
Let the trial be expedited in this manner and concluded without any unnecessary delay.
       Snkumar/-                                (Navin Sinha,J.)
