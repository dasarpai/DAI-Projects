The second respondent is directed to dispose of the appeal within a period of two months from now. The petitioner shall produce a copy of this judgment before the second respondent for compliance and if the appeal is dismissed, the bank guarantee can be enforced without any delay. The petitioner should keep the bank guarantee valid until payment or until cancellation of penalty.
