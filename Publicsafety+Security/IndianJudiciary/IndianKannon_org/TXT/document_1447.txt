22. 17.08.2010 This first appeal has been listed under the heading to be mentioned at the instance of the respondent.
The learned counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the appeals were filed against the judgment and decree passed by the Land Acquisition Judge and this Court while disposing of the bunch of first appeals dismissing the first appeals, confirmed the judgment and award passed by the Learned Acquisition Judge but at paragraph 26 of the judgment because of typographical mistake in place of Land Acquisition Judge it has been typed as Land Acquisition Officer.
Perused the judgment and paragraph 26 of the judgment dated 28.4.2010 passed by this Court while disposing of the first appeals. It appears that it is only a typing mistake. Therefore, in paragraph 26 the sentence 'Land Acquisition Officer' shall be read as 'Land Acquisition Judge'. Accordingly, paragraph 26 of the judgment stand corrected. This order shall form part of the judgment dated 28.4.2010.
