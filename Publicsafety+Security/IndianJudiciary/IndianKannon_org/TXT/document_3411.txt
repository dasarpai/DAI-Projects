The petitioner has approached this Court mainly contending that Exts.P6 and P7 have not been disposed of in accordance with law and that coercive steps are being taken without any regard to the pendency of the said proceedings.
2. The learned Government Pleader appearing on behalf of the respondents, on instruction, submits that the statutory appeals have already been considered and dismissed on 10.09.2008 and that the petitioner, if aggrieved of the same in any manner, has to challenge the same, in accordance with law.
In the said circumstances, nothing further remains to be considered in the Writ Petition, which is dismissed accordingly, without prejudice to the rights of the petitioner to challenge the concerned orders in accordance with law.
P.R. RAMACHANDRA MENON, JUDGE.
