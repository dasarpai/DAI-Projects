: The petitioners are accused in the case registered under Sections 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in this case due to land dispute and enmity; there is no iota of material against the petitioners to show their complicity; they are in custody since September, 2010 without any cogent basis; they are local permanent residents; there is no chance of their absconding.
Learned A.P.P. opposed the petitioners' prayer for bail and submitted that there are strong suspicion against the petitioners because of the land dispute; they had also given threats earlier; however, after going through the case diary, has not disputed the other contentions of learned counsel for the petitioners.
Regard being had to the facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioners, above named, are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (rupees ten thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount, each, to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Palamau at Daltonganj in connection with Chhattarpur P.S. Case No. 182 of 2008, corresponding to G.R. No.1836 of 2008.
